      <title>Case 182: Mousetrap</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/182</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A senior monk who was jealous of the nun Zjing&#x2019;s recent
promotion decided to spy on her work.  Opening a
recent project, he was astonished to find her code
a confusing mess, riddled with obvious bugs.
He notified master Banzen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old master thanked the monk for his diligence and bade
him remain a moment.  Banzen then called young master Zjing
and put her on speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/pages/case-182/mouse.jpg" alt="" title="They&amp;#39;re really just nature&amp;#39;s little cat toys." class="illus-right"/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Say something about this &#x2018;mouse&#x2019; project you created,&#x201D;
ordered Banzen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;It is of exceedingly poor design,&#x201D; said Zjing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senior monk smiled with satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banzen asked, &#x201C;How poor?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;This morning, our Software Quality Assessment tools found
three hundred and eight separate deficiencies,&#x201D; replied Zjing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;That &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a problem,&#x201D; said Banzen.  &#x201C;If memory serves,
they should have found three hundred and &lt;i&gt;twenty&lt;/i&gt;.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Correct,&#x201D; said Zjing.  &#x201C;Someone appears to have deactivated
the rules which detect resource leaks.  The project&#x2019;s self-test
notified me; I am investigating.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banzen bid her good hunting and turned to the monk.  &#x201C;If
ever you fear there are mice in your walls, listen to common
wisdom and buy four fine cats.  But listen to Zjing also,
and release a single mouse among the cats every day&amp;mdash;to make certain they have not forgotten how to hunt.&#x201D;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 181: Future Imperfect</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/181</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/181</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This same nun visited Shinpuru in his
garden the following day, where the monk was doing the last
of his winter weeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;You spoke to me of looking to the future,&#x201D; said the nun.
&#x201C;But what are we in the future but mouldering corpses?  Why,
you are practically half a corpse now!  I have seen how you
let younger monks lead the projects you are offered.  You
voice no objection when these upstarts choose arcane new
technologies that render your decades of knowledge
irrelevant&amp;mdash;instead you struggle to catch up, and contribute
less each year than the year before!  Why should I follow
you when you walk willingly into your own grave?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shinpuru pulled a withered stalk, gave it to the nun, and
said, &#x201C;This will not suit my garden.  For though it still
clings to life, it will steal water from the seedlings and
bear only bitter fruit.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shinpuru then put his ear to a second stalk, identical to the
first.  After a moment he nodded.  &#x201C;This one can stay, for
it wishes only to be part of a sweet harvest.&#x201D;  He pulled
the second stalk, crumpled it in his hands, and tilled the flakes
deep into the soil to await the coming of spring.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/pages/case-181/Weeding.jpg" alt="" title="By a strange coincidence, after writing this case I found out that Leonard Nimoy tweeted this quote just before he died: &amp;quot;A life is like a garden.  Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory.&amp;quot;" class="illus-center"/&gt;

      <title>Case 180: Past Perfect</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/180</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/180</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Snow still covered the temple grounds when a senior nun
happened upon the old monk Shinpuru clearing dead stalks
from his garden.  Soon their talk turned to matters
befitting two old warriors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;I liked our profession better in my youth,&#x201D; said the
nun. &#x201C;In those days my temple was a simple place, where work
was pleasant and mastery came easy.  All we needed were text
editors to code, &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; to compile, and shell scripts to
connect everything up.  But today&amp;mdash;what misery!  For each
new technology I must learn new design patterns, new
libraries, and new toolchains.  Our build process is
inflexible, the design meetings interminable, the code
reviews insulting, the testers intolerant, and the deadlines
insane.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Then the years have been kinder to me,&#x201D; said Shinpuru.
&#x201C;For in the days of my youth my temple was a primitive
place, where we celebrated victories that now seem laughably
small.  But today&amp;mdash;what bliss!  For each new technology
there are so many tools that with a little study I can
achieve what would once have been impossible.  And if our
quickening pace leads me to stumble, a dozen monks will
catch me before I fall.  You should leave your miserable
temple and come to mine.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nun raised an eyebrow.  &#x201C;My brother Shinpuru is mocking
me, for we labor side-by-side today, just as we have done
since we were children.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Then I should escort you safely back to our abbey,&#x201D; said
Shinpuru.  &#x201C;For your eyes are so glued to the beautiful
scenery behind you, I fear you will walk backwards off that
cliff.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 179: Walking the Path</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/179</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/179</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src="/pages/case-179/falling.jpg" alt="" title="Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the rice bowl as it fell was &amp;quot;Oh no, not again...&amp;quot;" class="illus-right"/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Master Bawan was assisting the Elephant's Footprint Clan
in creating a database service for the temple&#x2019;s audit logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;We shall need at least three weeks to determine which NoSQL
database engine would be best for this task,&#x201D; said Bawan
to the abbot of that clan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;No need,&#x201D; said the abbot.  &#x201C;The Temple of the Burning Pool
has recently chosen a NoSQL engine for their own purposes.
Follow the path they have taken.  We shall save much time.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master flung his bowl hard at the abbot&#x2019;s head.  The
abbot ducked, and the bowl sailed harmlessly out the
tower window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;See what your infamous temper has cost you, little master!&#x201D;
laughed the abbot.  &#x201C;Now you have lost your bowl, and it is
nearly time to line up for supper!&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one swift motion, Bawan flung the abbot out the window.
Then he turned to the pair of astonished novices still in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;The abbot is following the path my bowl has taken,&#x201D;
explained the master.  &#x201C;Come; perhaps he will save us a
place in line.&#x201D;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 178: Unity</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/178</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/178</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A nasty stomach flu had been making its way through the
Temple.  Fully half the Spider Clan had fallen victim,
so to meet deadlines the monk Wangohan had been forced
to team with his longtime nemesis, the monk Landhwa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid conflicts that might lead to
yet another incapacitated developer,
their newly appointed master-in-training Zjing
decided that they should work in separate shifts&amp;mdash;Landhwa by day, Wangohan by night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Finally,&#x201D; said Zjing on the videoconferencing monitor,
&#x201C;we cannot risk delays caused by arguments over coding
style.  But neither do I wish to have two separate styles in
one application.  Therefore, as Wangohan is new to this
project, he will follow Landhwa&#x2019;s style as precisely as
possible.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wangohan bowed his assent and took his leave to rest before
the night&#x2019;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When night fell, Wangohan began to familiarize himself with
Landhwa&#x2019;s source code.  He was pleased to see that there
were no magic literals, but pleasure turned to horror when
he discovered that every constant in the application&amp;mdash;regardless of purpose&amp;mdash;had been declared in a single,
huge, uncommented &lt;i&gt;Constants.java&lt;/i&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
   ...
   public static final String HELP = "HELP";
   public static final String HELP2 = "Need help?";
   public static final String HELPU = "/help";
   public static final String HELPTA = "{{help}}";
   public static final String HELPTB = "${help}";
   public static final String HTTP = "HTTP";
   public static final String HTTPU = "http://";
   public static final String HTTPS = "https";
   ...
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wangohan was about to refactor the file when he remembered
Zjing&#x2019;s decree.  Not wishing to disrespect the nascent
authority of his longtime friend, Wangohan lifted his fingers
from the keyboard and scowled at the monitor for a long
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, Landhwa found a message waiting for him
from Wangohan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;    All has been coded according to your example.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landhwa pulled the latest changes from the repository and found
that nearly every source file had disappeared.  Only two remained.
The first Landhwa recognized; the second was but a few hours old:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    Constants.java            48K
    Code.java               8090K

&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Case 177: The Tool-Shed</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/177</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/177</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The monk Djishin was walking in the forest, when he
came upon a man sawing wood by the edge of the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;What are you making, friend?&#x201D; asked Djishin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;A tiny tool-shed that I have sorely needed,&#x201D; said the man.
&#x201C;It will have one hook for my rake, another for my spade,
and a place on the floor for my tin pail.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Djishin wished the man good health and continued on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day Djishin came upon this same man sawing wood.
Many posts had been set into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;How goes your work today, friend?&#x201D; asked Djishin.
&#x201C;That is a wider tool-shed than I&#x2019;d imagined.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said the man, &#x201C;Last night I wondered: what if I buy more
rakes or pails, or wish to store clay pots?  So now it is a
proper garden-shed.  See, here will go a window, with a
shelf to start my seedlings.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Djishin wished the man good health and continued on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day Djishin came upon this same man sawing wood.
Many more posts had been set into the ground, and joists for
a floor, and ceiling beams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;How goes your work today, friend?&#x201D; asked Djishin.
&#x201C;That is a taller garden-shed than I&#x2019;d imagined.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said the man, &#x201C;Last night I thought: if I add
a second storey, it would make a cozy cottage where I could
rest after a hard day&#x2019;s gardening.  See, here will go a ladder,
where I may climb to a loft with a humble bed.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Djishin wished the man good health and continued on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day Djishin came upon this same man sawing wood.
Many more posts had been set into the ground, and ceiling
beams, but the floor had been torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;How goes your work today, friend?&#x201D; asked Djishin.
&#x201C;That is a larger cottage than I&#x2019;d imagined.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said the man, &#x201C;Last night I decided: stairs are better than
a ladder, for under them one may keep clothes and shoes.  In
which case I may as well build a proper house, with a
kitchen and a bathing-room, and give it to my son when he is
grown.  See, here will go a fine stone floor, when I have
money to pay the quarry.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Djishin wished the man good health and continued on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day Djishin came upon this same man sawing wood.
Still more posts had been set into the ground, with
rickety catwalks between them.  From the ceiling beams hung
ropes and pulleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;How goes your work today, friend?&#x201D; asked Djishin.
&#x201C;That is a grander house than I&#x2019;d imagined.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said the man, &#x201C;Last night I realized: my son may someday
wish a wife and family.  So I am putting all in readiness for
an estate of any size, depending on the number of children
he foresees.  See, here are the ramps to carry flagstones
for the floor, and scaffolding he can climb to set the roof
tiles.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Djishin wished the man good health and continued on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day Djishin was at his terminal when master Banzen
came in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;How goes your work today, monk?&#x201D; asked Banzen.
&#x201C;I expect you need more time to implement this grand email
framework you devised last week.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;No more time,&#x201D; said Djishin, swivelling his monitor to face
the master.  &#x201C;I have dismantled the bones of my estate, and
built for you this fine tool-shed.&#x201D;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 176: Many Happy Returns</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/176</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/176</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A novice monk said to master Kaimu, &#x201C;I have heard that it is
preferable to have only one return statement in a
function.  Do you agree?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaimu asked, &#x201C;Where is your bowl?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk apologized and left to fetch his bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the monk returned, he showed his bowl to the master
and said, &#x201C;I have heard that it is preferable to have
only one return statement in a function.  Do you agree?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaimu asked, &#x201C;Why is there no rice in your bowl?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk apologized and left to fetch some rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the monk returned, he showed his bowl full of steaming
white rice to the master and said, &#x201C;I have heard that it is
preferable to have only one return statement in a
function.  Do you agree?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaimu took the monk&#x2019;s bowl and placed it on his
desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;You speak of a most venerable design principle, known as
&lt;i&gt;Single-Entry Single-Exit&lt;/i&gt;,&#x201D; said the master.  He then told
the monk of the glorious days of coding long past, when
memory was low, hardware was slow, and resources had to be
managed with care.  &#x201C;For C did you no favors,&#x201D; said Kaimu,
&#x201C;and Assembly did half as many as that.  So if your function
borrowed a thing, then your function had to put it back.
And how was this most easily done?  By putting all the
cleanup code in one place, at the function&#x2019;s bottom... a
tradition that continues to this day.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaimu then spoke of the birth of objects, of destructors and
finalizers.  He spoke of garbage collection too; of
reference counting and mark-and-sweep, and compilers that
could tell when an object went out of scope.  He
spoke of buffers that grew as needed and vanished when not,
of files that closed themselves, of connection
pools and thread pools and try-with-resources, and of how
wondrous and magical was the modern bestiary of languages,
where monks could devote their energies to more interesting
problems instead of fussing about with &lt;tt&gt;malloc&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt&gt;free&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;goto fail&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; said the weary monk at last.  &#x201C;But do you &lt;i&gt;agree&lt;/i&gt;
with the design principle of Single-Entry Single-Exit, or do
you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaimu looked down and said, &#x201C;Why is the rice in your bowl
white, and not brown?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 175: Flat Shark</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/175</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/175</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A monk asked Java master Kaimu: &lt;br /&gt;
What is the &#x201C;single-responsibility principle&#x201D;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/pages/case-175/shark.jpg" alt="" title="Ceci n&amp;#39;est pas une peinture." class="illus-right"/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Said Kaimu: &lt;br /&gt;
That a class shall do exactly one thing, &lt;br /&gt;
and do it completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk asked: &lt;br /&gt;
How shall I decide this &#x201C;one thing&#x201D;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said Kaimu: &lt;br /&gt;
The Fisherman does not build ships, &lt;br /&gt;
or we would call him a Shipwright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk asked: &lt;br /&gt;
Is there no room in your philosophy for interfaces? &lt;br /&gt;
What if my class can serve as a Fisherman, &lt;br /&gt;
and a Shipwright and Sailor besides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said Kaimu: &lt;br /&gt;
What would you name such a three-headed monster?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk replied: &lt;br /&gt;
Sh&#x00ED;sho, after my uncle.  He lives by the sea and does all these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said Kaimu: &lt;br /&gt;
I would give your class Sh&#x00ED;sho three instance variables: &lt;br /&gt;
a Fisherman, a Shipwright, and a Sailor. &lt;br /&gt;
Then Sh&#x00ED;sho may implement those interfaces by delegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk replied: &lt;br /&gt;
I speak of inheritance, yet you answer in composition. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of my uncle is a Fisherman, not just his left foot. &lt;br /&gt;
What use are objects, if we do not faithfully model the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said Kaimu: &lt;br /&gt;
If I paint a fine shark upon this page, will you say, &#x201C;Fine shark!&#x201D; &lt;br /&gt;
or will you complain that it is flat and does not eat you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk asked: &lt;br /&gt;
But how are we to know when the flat shark is shark enough? &lt;br /&gt;
Or when our uncle should fish with his left foot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said Kaimu: &lt;br /&gt;
Learning how is &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; &#x201C;single reponsibility&#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Qi&#x2019;s Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every class does exactly one thing&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
but sometimes that one thing &lt;br /&gt;
is &#x201C;doing too many things&#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Qi&#x2019;s Poem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning Kaimu took up his brush. &lt;br /&gt;
In two strokes he painted an exquisite shark. &lt;br /&gt;
A passerby laughed. &#x201C;It is a poor shark that can&#x2019;t open its mouth!&#x201D; &lt;br /&gt;
Kaimu replied, &#x201C;Even so, it has told me that you are a fool.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 174: Out of the Zone</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/174</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/174</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The nun Zjing had a well-known fear of heights.
For this reason she lived in the valley far below the mountaintop
temple, and had only braved the treacherous cliffside paths
but once.  Through webcams, phone and IM she had maintained
an effective telepresence in the Temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was with some trepidation that she received this email
from master Banzen on the evening of the longest night
of winter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;  An important Temple matter has arisen, and I desire your
  confidential input.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;  My schedule has an opening tomorrow when the dawn bell is struck.
  We may converse electronically if you so desire, but I would prefer
  to speak in person in my office.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;  B.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In darkness Zjing dutifully ascended the first of the steep
stairs that had been hewn out of the mountain walls.  Higher
and higher she climbed, trying hard not to let her gaze fall
to the wintry foothills below.  Snowdrifts blocked her path;
she scrambled over them.  Rope bridges creaked underfoot;
she crossed them.  Great moonlit icicles trembled overhead,
tall as trees, sharp as spears, threatening to fall at the
slightest whisper; she edged past them without a sound.
Howling winds threatened to tear her off the foot-wide path
and return her to the valley quickly and permanently; she
clung to the rock face and forced herself to continue,
hand-hold by miserable hand-hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last echo of the dawn bell, Zjing appeared
at Banzen&#x2019;s door.  She bowed and entered, betraying no emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banzen closed the door behind her.  &#x201C;I have just heard from
master Suku,&#x201D; he said.  &#x201C;Although she was to return to us
this winter, she has decided instead to remain in the
Far Provinces.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Does she no longer love our Temple?&#x201D; asked Zjing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;It is &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; she loves our Temple that she will not
return yet,&#x201D; said the master.  &#x201C;She has found her travels to
be surprisingly edifying, both for herself and her
apprentices.  True, they are weary and weathered, and the
comforts of home would be most welcome now.  But there is
much more to teach and to learn.  If Suku extends her
travels, all will benefit greatly in the end.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;This past year has been most difficult for the Spider Clan
without her guidance,&#x201D; said Zjing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Indeed,&#x201D; agreed Banzen. &#x201C;A replacement must be trained.
As a senior nun of that clan, I called you here to learn
who you would suggest.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Can one &lt;i&gt;train&lt;/i&gt; a monk to be a master?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banzen chuckled.  &#x201C;Did you think that I was born with this
title?  In our Temple, &lt;i&gt;master&lt;/i&gt; is not an honorific, but a
verb disguised as an adjective.  The candidate becomes by
learning, and learns by doing.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zjing pondered the many senior monks she knew.
All had virtues to speak of, but vices as well.
&#x201C;What qualities are you most looking for in such a
candidate?&#x201D; she asked at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;The first quality is the same one that master Suku herself
has demonstrated,&#x201D; said Banzen.  He walked over to his
window and gazed across the gorge.  The thin light of dawn
was just now illuminating the last few zig-zags of the steep,
terrible path up from the valley.  &#x201C;The first quality is a
willingness to leave one&#x2019;s comfort zone when duty calls.&#x201D;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 173: Lost Peer</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/173</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/173</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From &#x201C;The Courtship of Eku and Mugen&#x201D;:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a class="footnoteref" id="noteref-1" href="#note-1"&gt;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time, as ancient logs recall, &lt;br /&gt;
when you and I would Handshake every morn &lt;br /&gt;
through packets on an Ether-network borne &lt;br /&gt;
our love conveyed by formal Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So high was your availability, &lt;br /&gt;
a timeout span in minutes would I set&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
secure that neither POST nor PUT nor GET &lt;br /&gt;
would e&#x2019;er a 504 return to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when your subnet&#x2019;s firewall arose, &lt;br /&gt;
you bade its router map a secret port &lt;br /&gt;
through which we could clandestinely consort&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
a backdoor assignation, undisclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discreetly you&#x2019;d a server-socket bind &lt;br /&gt;
to listen at your gate for my connect &lt;br /&gt;
But if this host address be still correct, &lt;br /&gt;
Then why resounding silence do I find?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My every last connection is refused, &lt;br /&gt;
my buffered input streams have all run dry, &lt;br /&gt;
the root nodes of our JSON trees I spy &lt;br /&gt;
now withered on the heap; they die unused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh! Where can you have gone, beloved peer? &lt;br /&gt;
A segmentation fault?  A kill-dash-9? &lt;br /&gt;
No, say you live!  And if the fault be mine, &lt;br /&gt;
I&#x2019;ll every line rewrite &#x2018;til you appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x2018;Til then &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; iterate from one to &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Yet never take exception when I fail &lt;br /&gt;
but catch myself, and log, and weep, and wail, &lt;br /&gt;
then sleep an interval, and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus furtively alone at night I&#x2019;ll SYN &lt;br /&gt;
and dream that you will send some answer back&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, SYN with me!  And promise we shall ACK &lt;br /&gt;
until we both lie sated, kiss... and FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x2019;ll seek thee there with netcat minus-z! &lt;br /&gt;
I&#x2019;ll seek thee here with netstat minus-t! &lt;br /&gt;
Let others mock my hopeless loyalty&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
They only serve who serve HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Qi&#x2019;s Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mugen liked to code in poetry.  Presumably, the seventh stanza
is meant to convey an algorithm like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    SocketAddress sockAddr = new InetSocketAddress(host, port);
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= N_TRIES; i++) {
        try {
            client.connect(sockAddr, TIMEOUT_MILLIS);
            return client;
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            log.warning("weep, wail");
            Thread.sleep(INTERVAL_MILLIS);
        }
    }
    throw new IOException("give up");
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is theorized that his ten-thousand-stanza epic, &lt;i&gt;The Dromedary&lt;/i&gt;,
describes a Perl-to-OCaml converter written in C++.
No scholar can stay sane long enough to be certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;
&lt;div class='footnote' id='note-1'&gt;&lt;a href='#noteref-1'&gt;&lt;sup class='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Dedicated to Stanislaw Lem, with profuse apologies&lt;a class="footnoteref" id="noteref-2" href="#note-2"&gt;&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to my translators.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='footnote' id='note-2'&gt;&lt;a href='#noteref-2'&gt;&lt;sup class='footnote'&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Guys, please don&#x2019;t kill me for this.  Really, you can skip this one.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Case 172: Lesson One</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/172</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/172</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src="/pages/case-172/apple.jpg" alt="" title="Nature will often use a dumped core to start a child process." class="illus-right"/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jinyu, the ancient Abbess over all Clans and Concerns,
summoned young master Kaimu to her presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;A dozen students from the Western Heap are staying in the
village below,&#x201D; said Jinyu.  &#x201C;They have yet to choose a
vocation and they are curious about programming.  Go, spend
the week with them, teach them something.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaimu did this gladly, for he had long wished to foster in
others his own love of the Art of Unseen Engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the week&#x2019;s end he was summoned again to Jinyu&#x2019;s
presence.  She held in her wrinkled hands a sheaf of letters
with familiar purple postal-marks.  &#x201C;What word from the
students of the Western Heap?&#x201D; asked Kaimu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jinyu whacked the master on the head with her umbrella.
&#x201C;All have reported unfavorably.  Your speech was too rapid,
your slides were too terse, your gestures distracting, your
examples inane, and you gave no bathroom breaks.  In the
rare moments when you were not tedious or garrulous, you
were utterly incomprehensible.  None thought the class worth
their while.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaimu was aghast.  &#x201C;Did no one learn anything?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answer, Jinyu whacked him on the head again.  &#x201C;What now
may be said of Kaimu?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;That he cannot teach,&#x201D; said Kaimu miserably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jinyu nodded in satisfaction.  &#x201C;Then one thing has been learned.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Kaimu bowed and turned to go, Jinyu stopped him and
said: &#x201C;From one apple seed a fool makes only a bitter meal,
but the gardener may grow a sweet harvest.  Go, find your
shovel.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaimu was comforted.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 171: Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/171</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/171</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src="/pages/case-171/detective.jpg" alt="" title="Does anyone else think it&amp;#39;s weird that the universal search icon is a magnifying glass?  When was the last time you searched for *anything* with a magnifiying glass in real life?  My ideal search icon would be a little picture of me, screaming &amp;quot;HAS ANYONE SEEN MY CAR KEYS?!&amp;quot;" class="illus-right"/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The nun Hw&#x00ED;dah was summoned to the offices of master
Banzen.  She found the master waiting with his
apprentice Djishin in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banzen said, &#x201C;A happy day for you, little nun!  Since you
take such pleasure in learning hidden truths and seeing
guilty parties corrected, I have an entertaining task for you.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;I serve at the pleasure of the Temple, not my own,&#x201D; Hw&#x00ED;dah
replied with a dutiful bow.  But her stomach was already
clenched; for no doubt this was the start of her
punishment for trespassing on forbidden Temple ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;An infrequent but stubborn error has plagued the
Elephant's Footprint Clan for some time now,&#x201D; said the
master as he handed the nun a printout.  &#x201C;Our database logs
show this malformed SQL query, yet a thorough
search of our code base reveals no such query anywhere.
Find the source.  I give you one week.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hw&#x00ED;dah studied the paper.  &#x201C;A few minutes should suffice.
May I borrow the master&#x2019;s terminal?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banzen&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up.  He exchanged glances with his
apprentice, then slid his laptop toward the nun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hw&#x00ED;dah consulted the printout, typed something, scrutinized
the screen, consulted the printout again, and so on several
times over.  &#x201C;There,&#x201D; she said finally, turning the screen
around.  The cursor was indeed hovering over a SQL fragment
with a missing right parenthesis.  &#x201C;If I return to my
workstation, I can trace this code to its consumers and
reproduce the error seen in the logs.  Then we may repair
the defect with confidence.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Go,&#x201D; said Banzen to Hw&#x00ED;dah.
To his apprentice he said: &#x201C;Observe.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the pair walked to Hw&#x00ED;dah&#x2019;s cubicle, Djishin whispered,
&#x201C;The speed of your diagnosis was surprising.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;A simple matter,&#x201D; said Hw&#x00ED;dah, handing the printout to the
monk.  &#x201C;The malformed query begins with &lt;tt&gt;WHERE 1=1&lt;/tt&gt;.
That has the stink of dynamically-generated SQL&amp;mdash;for
although the initial condition is trivial, its &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
value allows a developer to append any number of
&lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; conditions as simple &lt;tt&gt;AND&lt;/tt&gt; clauses.  I have
used this technique myself when implementing search forms
with optional fields.  Once I recognized it, I merely
searched our code for the individual &lt;tt&gt;AND&lt;/tt&gt; clauses.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;You misunderstand me,&#x201D; said Djishin.  &#x201C;I was not surprised
that you were &lt;i&gt;able&lt;/i&gt; to solve it immediately; I was
surprised that you did so despite being given a full week.
That has the stink of ambition&amp;mdash;for although this initial
problem was trivial, your ready truthfulness
now allows my master to entrust you with any number of &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt;
problems.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hw&#x00ED;dah sighed.  &#x201C;It is just as well.  If I had pretended
that this problem was difficult enough to merit days of
effort, Banzen would have thought me either deceitful or
incompetent.  Neither would sit well with me.  That is what
he truly wished to discover.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Djishin nodded.  &#x201C;Sometimes a test serves a purpose
&lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; the answer is so obvious.&#x201D;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 170: The Purple Beggar</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/170</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/170</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A certain monk of the Clan of Iron Bones approached host
master Yishi-Shing, saying: &#x201C;A thousand pardons, master,
but ever since last week&#x2019;s operating system upgrade I have
not been able to bring up our backup disk array.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yishi-Shing asked, &#x201C;What have you tried, other than
pestering me?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk said: &#x201C;I have contacted the disk vendor&amp;mdash;they say
our new system is not supported.  I have pored through their
documentation&amp;mdash;it is next to useless.  I have scoured the
web for others in my situation&amp;mdash;none can be found.  I have
begged for help in online forums&amp;mdash;not a single reply have
I received.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yishi-Shing said: &#x201C;Show me this &#x2018;begging for help&#x2019;.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk opened his laptop and indicated his many polite
pleas for assistance.  Indeed, all were unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yishi-Shing shook his head.  &#x201C;Then we have our answer.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master took the laptop from the monk&#x2019;s hands and
cross-posted the following to a dozen message boards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;     &lt;b&gt;**WARNING**&lt;/b&gt; Thundering Elephant&#x2019;s 24-terabyte disk arrays
     CANNOT be mounted under Petulant Penguin kernel 89!
     No workaround is possible!  AVOID THIS SETUP!!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yishi-Shing then closed the laptop and walked away, humming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening the master summoned the monk and asked him
what news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk opened his laptop.  &#x201C;Five separate posters have
each called me a blithering idiot and offered a simple
solution to my problem, which they claim to have tested on
their own systems.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yishi-Shing nodded.  &#x201C;My walk once took me past a beggar
whose sign read, &lt;i&gt;You do not DARE throw coins at ME!&lt;/i&gt;
His body was purple with bruises but his bowl was always full.&#x201D;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case 169: Best Practices</title>
      <link>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/169</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://thecodelesscode.com/case/169</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src="/pages/case-169/books.jpg" alt="" title="I&amp;#39;ll just stick that &amp;quot;Standards and Practices&amp;quot; book right here, between &amp;quot;The Plumber&amp;#39;s Encyclopedia of Pipe Fittings&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;1001 Gum Diseases (Color Illustrated)&amp;quot;." class="illus-right"/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The old scribe Qi was summoned to a meeting with two senior
abbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first abbot said, &#x201C;Developers are ignoring our many
Standards and Practices documents.  We have checked the
files in to a project in the source repository; no one
downloads it.  We have made PDF links available on a special
web page; no one visits it.  We have painstakingly copied
the content into a wiki; no one browses it.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second abbot said, &#x201C;We are now considering &lt;i&gt;printing out&lt;/i&gt;
the entire set, and binding it as a book.  We would
place one copy on each developer&#x2019;s desk.  What is your
opinion?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Bind them in white paper,&#x201D; said the scribe.  &#x201C;When a year
has passed, the thick dust will not show as readily.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;We wish developers to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; them,&#x201D; said the first abbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D; said the scribe.  &#x201C;Then bind them in red paper, for
when the nights grow cold they will burn more cheerily.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;We wish developers to &lt;i&gt;read&lt;/i&gt; them,&#x201D; said the second abbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Then let me know how you achieve this!&#x201D; said the scribe.
&#x201C;For I have never found a way to make anyone read anything
against their will.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Why do you play the fool instead of helping?!&#x201D; shouted
the first abbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#x201C;W&#x00FA;,&#x201D;&lt;/i&gt; said the scribe.  &#x201C;You brought in wild dogs who
have ruined three sofas, and now you&#x2019;re asking me what color
the fourth should be.  I keep telling you: it is not the
furniture that needs to be changed.&#x201D;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When their respective apprentices had retired for the night, &lt;br /&gt;
masters Suku and Yaqqana spoke beside the fire-pit &lt;br /&gt;
in Yaqqana&#x2019;s little monastery.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yaqqana said:&lt;/i&gt; Let us compare the ways of our temples, &lt;br /&gt;
to see what we may learn from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Suku replied:&lt;/i&gt; That is agreeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yaqqana said:&lt;/i&gt; Our systems are built of many components, &lt;br /&gt;
each layered like the earth itself: &lt;br /&gt;
persistence is the stony foundation, &lt;br /&gt;
business logic the fertile soil, &lt;br /&gt;
presentation the fragrant blossoms &lt;br /&gt;
delighting the world-wide sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Suku replied:&lt;/i&gt; We do likewise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yaqqana said:&lt;/i&gt; Our designs are guided by three principles: &lt;br /&gt;
loose coupling between components, &lt;br /&gt;
strong cohesion within them, &lt;br /&gt;
and encapsulation always where developer meets developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Suku replied:&lt;/i&gt; We think likewise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yaqqana said:&lt;/i&gt; Our means to this end is self-evident: &lt;br /&gt;
each monk is assigned one component at a time, &lt;br /&gt;
coding its layers as he sees fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Suku replied:&lt;/i&gt; Here you and I part ways&amp;mdash;for in our temple, &lt;br /&gt;
each monk is assigned one layer at a time, &lt;br /&gt;
yet codes across many different components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yaqqana said:&lt;/i&gt; Our way&#x2019;s virtues are readily seen: &lt;br /&gt;
Each component is consistent throughout, &lt;br /&gt;
yet a black box to its neighbors left and right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Suku replied:&lt;/i&gt; Our way&#x2019;s virtues are likewise apparent: &lt;br /&gt;
Each layer is consistent throughout, &lt;br /&gt;
yet a black box to its neighbors above and below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yaqqana said:&lt;/i&gt; Your way would kill us by stagnation&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
for so many must speak before code is written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Suku replied:&lt;/i&gt; Your way would doom us by chaos&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
for so much may be coded before anyone speaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yaqqana said:&lt;/i&gt; When our temple was built, &lt;br /&gt;
it was on foundations of respect, &lt;br /&gt;
and mutual reliance, &lt;br /&gt;
and creativity, &lt;br /&gt;
and independence. &lt;br /&gt;
We trust even our middling monks to deliver code of quality, &lt;br /&gt;
and this I would not change for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Suku replied:&lt;/i&gt; Nor would I ask you to. &lt;br /&gt;
Your temple is not our temple; your needs are not our needs. &lt;br /&gt;
Therefore let us agree upon one thing more, &lt;br /&gt;
which is to part amicably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thus did the two embrace in friendship, &lt;br /&gt;
and wish each other pleasant dreams.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="break" src="/images/hrule.png" alt="- - -" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But when Yaqqana had retired, and Suku was alone, &lt;br /&gt;
she whispered to the dying fire:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your temple was built, &lt;br /&gt;
did masons cut the foundation stones? &lt;br /&gt;
and did carpenters hew the beams? &lt;br /&gt;
and did plumbers lay the pipes? &lt;br /&gt;
and did roofers set the tiles? &lt;br /&gt;
Or did a hundred middling laborers choose one room each, &lt;br /&gt;
and build it entire from earth to sky?
&lt;/p&gt;
