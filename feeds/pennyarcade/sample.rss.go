        <description><![CDATA[Tycho: Aside from a couple high profile indiscretions - on par with, let&#8217;s say, a dalliance with a footman - I haven&#8217;t purchased retail software of any kind.&nbsp; As soon as they gave me the opportunity not to, I stopped doing it in much the same way we stopped marrying our cousins.&nbsp; It&#8217;s simply not the done thing. We have a Northron in our employ; another indiscretion, to be sure, but she is sworn to our banner and has undergone the Rite of Renunciation.&nbsp; The Canadian Pharaoh has no power over her.&nbsp; She asked if we could prowl around for Amiibos down here, maybe&hellip;]]></description>

        <link>http://penny-arcade.com/news/post/2015/02/13/the-new-3ds</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Gabe: I was able to score a New 3DS yesterday afternoon along with a copy of Majora’s Mask. I’m excited because I actually missed this Zelda game when it originally came out. I remember I had to sell my N64 that year so that I could afford a plane ticket to E3. Since I never ended up playing it, the game is new to me. I don’t have much to say about the game or the system yet, but I do want to say that the improved 3D tech is really cool.   I had essentially stopped using the 3D mode on my old 3DS because it was such a pain to keep my head in the right spot. Also I like to play it laying down&hellip;]]></description>

        <link>http://penny-arcade.com/news/post/2015/02/13/chant</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Gabe: So I actually only read Tycho&#8217;s first chapter a couple days ago. He&#8217;s been working hard on it and I have to say the end result is even better than I expected. I loved Chant immediately and had to figure out what he looked like.&nbsp; So I went to my sketchbook.   This is the first sketch I did of him. I&#8217;ve been drawing Lookouts for years now but this was the first time I really thought about these little boys and how brutal their task is. I had this idea of Chant with his black eye, his missing tooth, covered in some monster&#8217;s blood and just proud as hell.     I kept&hellip;]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Tycho: When the lamp had grown too dim to see by, Chant fed in a few more bitter leaves.&nbsp; After a few moments, as was their way, the worms had turned the leaves to light. He wasn&#8217;t good at sleeping, he didn&#8217;t really know how; there was some trick to it he never could quite figure out.&nbsp; It seemed to come so easily to everyone else, that surrender, but Chant had the sense - had always had the sense - that something was at the door, peeking under it, or gazing hungrily through the crack, waiting for his guard to drop.&nbsp; When the fires were lit on the Big Wall, the yawning&hellip;]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Tycho: Apparently, a vasectomy - vasectimism? - can be caught.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve started a powerful trend other men are powerless to resist, and Goribraleelon swayed and danced to my flute.&nbsp; This is like a Pied Piper thing, I guess.&nbsp; Except my dick would be the flute in this case?&nbsp; I need to think through some of these metaphors before I commit to them, maybe.&nbsp; Like, just consider some of the ramifications. You might look at the comic and wonder if there could possibly be a podcast for that strip.&nbsp; Can the MP3 format even contain it, more like!!!&nbsp; But yes, it can;&hellip;]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Tycho: I have described previously how the pool of people who write professionally about games don&#8217;t really overlap with my life.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t really get in trouble for that; most people can&#8217;t help being who they are.&nbsp; You gotta take people as they come.&nbsp; They have been alternately &#8220;fed&#8221; or &#8220;shocked&#8221; on this grotesque spherical laboratory simply for doing what came naturally to them at every juncture, and now they&#8217;re human fucking wreckage, like everyone else. My &#8220;fucking wreckage&#8221; is simply inflected differently.&nbsp; I&hellip;]]></description>
