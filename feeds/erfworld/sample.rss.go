  <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;I wanted to go down to the hold, to watch through the porthole and direct the quakkens,&rdquo; said Fawksull, &ldquo;but I wasn&rsquo;t certain I&rsquo;d even be able to tell which ones were &lsquo;ours.&rsquo; And anyway, the battle above the waterline was just as important. I had to command the pooners, and the eagle.&rdquo;</p><p>He rubbed his hands together, pulling all of the old details together in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I called Gummel up to the quarterdeck first, where I stacked with him and the eagle both. Then, I ordered the eagle to use its one point to bless him. Specifically, to bless his throws.</p><p>&ldquo;By this time, the other pair of ferals had joined the undersea fray, and the ship was taking some bumping from below. Gummel held his big harpoon at the ready, and we both looked down over the starboard rail. The water rippled and churned as these huge yellow blotches darted around beneath us. It was all but impossible to tell which ones were friendly.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t certain whether to tell Gummel to throw at any random one or not. Harpoons against a quakken were not going to bother it much, so we needed a crit. But what if the Luckamancy point was wasted on just making sure he didn&rsquo;t hit the wrong target? I thought perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Governor,&rdquo; interrupted Admiral Harping.</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t used his title much, since they&rsquo;d sat down. &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost dawn,&rdquo; she said, leaning toward him. She looked tired. &ldquo;I would rather have these commanders back in their respective quarters, before everyone else rises. They&rsquo;ll never get the whole story at the rate you&rsquo;re telling it.&rdquo;</p><p>Fawksull blinked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, taking a deep breath. &ldquo;Of course. Sorry, Admiral.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think they get the idea about what the birds do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And by now, they know you&rsquo;re not a coward. Or a fool. You just like to talk.&rdquo; It was a kind enough rebuke, and Fawksull returned her smile with a crooked little nod of acknowledgement.</p><p>Cat looked over at her captains. &ldquo;We lost all three of our quakkens in the fight. But they managed to croak two of the feral ones first. The quakkens prefered to fight each other, rather than hitting the ship. So Fawksull used the early part of the fight to build up the eagle&rsquo;s points up to three, using more wild harpoon throws.</p><p>&ldquo;Then he used the points to bless the pooners, who croaked the other three ferals with lucky crits, just as they started hammering the ship. <em>Double Eagle</em> was left in deplorable condition, barely floating. But the Anchormen didn&rsquo;t return to the hex on that turn. Got it?&rdquo;</p><p>They all nodded and mumbled.</p><p>Fawksull gave Cat a purse-lipped, &ldquo;fair enough&rdquo; shrug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, uh...not quite certain where to pick up the story after that...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The next morning,&ldquo; she said, narrowing her eyes at him.</p><p>Ah. Another reason she was eager to advance the story. After the sun had set that day, and no other Anchorbar ships appeared, he and Cat had shared the big bed in the captain&rsquo;s stateroom. She didn&rsquo;t want him to mention this fact. Understood.</p><p>To be fair, though, she&rsquo;d insisted. And he&rsquo;d been a Noble about it, he supposed. They both were wounded, exhausted, and the bed had lots of room. They had lain there together in the dark. She took his hand, weakly. He curled around her, laying on his non-wounded side. And then they both slept beautifully until dawn.</p><p>&ldquo;The next morning...&rdquo; he began again. &ldquo;Well, I have to admit to you: I rose right before dawn and climbed up to the quarterdeck, just to be near to the eagle at start of turn.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked down at the tea table. &ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s right. I <em>was</em> pretty badly cut. And I&rsquo;m sure I felt relieved when the sun peeked up over the water to the east, and all of my aches and wounds were healed. But what I actually remember is the intense joy I felt when that silly bird&rsquo;s limp, ugly head lifted up and blinked at me. I had a fish in one hand, all ready for it. And a bucket of them at my feet.&rdquo; He looked up at them and smiled. &ldquo;Sorry if that&rsquo;s, um, sentimental.&rdquo;</p><p>The captains didn&rsquo;t seem to think he owed them an apology.</p><p>Cat cleared her throat. &ldquo;Fawksull...&rdquo; She pointed up at the lightening gray patch of sky, visible through the sitting room&rsquo;s skylight windows.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, right...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We reassigned crew from the survivors,&rdquo; Cat said, &ldquo;but the ship was too damaged. So we effected minor repairs and managed to get her up a single point of move.&rdquo;</p><p>The Admiral then pointed an accusing finger at Fawksull. &ldquo;<em>He</em> wanted to resign as captain,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>The captains looked at him with surprise, but he shrugged. &ldquo;To crew the boat with all seafarers,&rdquo; said the Governor. &ldquo;Maybe stretch our move to two.&rdquo;</p><p>A ship&rsquo;s move was a function of the total move of all seafarers in the crew, divided by a hidden number derived from the ship&rsquo;s design and sailing condition. Stepping down in favor of adding a seafarer to the crew might have worked. Duty would have allowed it, because there was a good tactical reason. It still made sense to him.</p><p>&ldquo;We only <em>needed</em> one move, to go back into the storm hex,&rdquo; said Cat dismissively. &ldquo;But the point is, neither I nor anyone else on board would hear of it. Every unit on every deck agreed: we would accept only <em>one</em> commander. Him. Forecastle. The lubber. When he argued, we nearly had the first mutiny in history intended to <em>keep</em> the captain of the ship!&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle felt his cheeks flush. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s exaggerating,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;And I still say you should have taken over command.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you return to the storm hex?&rdquo; asked Captain Penny.</p><p>&ldquo;So they couldn&rsquo;t see we had no more quakkens,&rdquo; said Admiral Harping. &ldquo;We actually used the longboats to orient the ship, and then sailed&mdash;if you can call it that&mdash;back into the storm.&rdquo;</p><p>Fawksull nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fun, being in a leaking boat in a storm hex, but it was our best bet. They scouted us there, but we sent the bird at them and they retreated. We stayed there for another whole turn, just focusing on repairs. Got some steering. Got some leaks shored up. That brought us up to five move.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We took an oblique course away from there,&rdquo; said Cat, &ldquo;trying to lose them. But they kept scouting us, one ship only. They moved in and out of the hex before we could sight them, or send the eagle after them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; said Fawksull. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the eagle would have helped. I suspect they were keeping their lubbers below by then. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been so easy to sink them. We kept expecting them to show up in force, since they should now be able to see we were without quakkens. But I suppose they could still see the bird.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For three turns, all they did was track us,&rdquo; said Cat. &ldquo;I think they knew they could crush us anytime, but they wanted to see where we were headed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the meantime, I was mainly concerned about the eagle&rsquo;s Luckamancy. I tried having the crew play cards and dice. I tried fishing, and anything else we could think of with an element of luck to it. We had exhausted the bird&rsquo;s reserve to zero in the battle, but five full turns later it had only gained one point back. And I don&rsquo;t even know where that point came from. We were not ready to face the Anchormen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then came <em>the turn</em>,&rdquo; said Cat ominously. &ldquo;The turn with the gun whale.&rdquo;</p><p>Fawksull took a deep breath and sighed it out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you all have heard this story, and maybe you think I&rsquo;m not really all that stupid or incompetent. Because if there ever was a true &lsquo;Forecastle&rsquo; move, then it&rsquo;d be what I did next...&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The Anchormen saw the bird fly out from our sails, right toward them, and they did not fire at us again,&rdquo; said Fawksull.</p><p>He cocked his head, feeling bemused. &ldquo;I sometimes wonder if it might have been as simple as that. Just...show our hand, have the eagle hover in the air between our ship and the enemys&rsquo;. Because I&rsquo;m <em>certain</em> they held their fire for fear of croaking it. It covered the entire distance between us and the Anchorbar fleet unmolested.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even in the heat of battle...&rdquo; wondered Captain Penny, the slight-built blondish man seated in the middle of the sofa.</p><p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said Fawksull. &ldquo;Superstition runs strong, as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aware. Though, by this point there really was no heat to the battle, per se. Only a terrible tension. My own crew, the few who were left alive, stood fixed at their posts, awaiting the final blast that would send us below. I was alone on the quarterdeck, with only Carrack&rsquo;s body for company.</p><p>&ldquo;We all watched the eagle fly right into the midst of their formation. It attacked the nearest ship at once, a low schooner or clipper. It was hard to see exactly what the bird was doing at that distance, but I know that it followed my orders. It picked up someone from the quarterdeck, dragged him overboard, and dropped him into the sea!&rdquo;</p><p>The captains straightened on the sofa. Chins went up, eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;I tried to keep a watch on it. I focused my mind on repeating its silent orders. <em>Find the lubber, the odd one on deck. Especially anyone in armor. Fly in, capture, and drown them. Use all your luck! Fly back here when you run out.</em> I didn&rsquo;t know if it would understand all of that, but it had seemed to, before it disappeared from my view.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about the quakkens?&rdquo; asked Captain Cottle, the gray-bearded man at the nearer end of the leather sofa.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I tried to order our quakkens into battle as well,&rdquo; nodded Fawksull. &ldquo;But you know, they don&rsquo;t take orders like tamed units. They wouldn&rsquo;t stray far from the <em>Double Eagle</em>. It was up to the bird to save us, with its six points of Luckamancy.&rdquo;</p><p>The Governor folded his hands on his lap, smiling at them. His story was nearly at an end. The sun would soon rise, and these confidants of Cat Harping would sail away in a turn or two. He didn&rsquo;t envy them. Probably, they&rsquo;d be headed for a major battle. At least he had armed them with something worthwhile, something the Royal Navy didn&rsquo;t want them to know. These captains might or might not ever have the privilege of commanding a tame double eagle; the Navy probably wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. But if the Anchormen showed up with one, at least they&rsquo;d know what they were up against.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; said Cat, smirking at her officers and stealing a bit of his thunder. &ldquo;So obviously, it did its job.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; admitted Fawksull. &ldquo;I believe it managed to pull five first mates or second officers overboard. The Anchormen finally started to attack the bird; I saw beams fly. But I think that only made things worse. Some of the ships had quakkens attacking from below, some were struck by friendly fire. I don&rsquo;t know if the eagle could fill up its reserves by causing critical fumbles while it was in close or engaging. Their beams looked pretty wild, but that could have been panic.</p><p>&ldquo;I only know that the eagle&rsquo;s attack left the Anchorbar fleet in complete chaos. The little schooner capsized, and the fleet formation broke apart and ran, in two directions. Three or four of their ships were badly damaged and imperiled. Those barely escaped the hex, being dogged from below by their own ducks.</p><p>&ldquo;The rest just didn&rsquo;t know what they were dealing with, and wanted out. There was a leadership gap, you see. Their fleet admiral had gone down with the man-o&rsquo;-war, we later discovered. Bit of good luck for us, there.&rdquo; He winked.</p><p>His audience wore triumphant grins and began to make congratulatory noises at him, but he held up his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on. The Anchormen escaped the hex, but, ah...their <em>quakkens</em> didn&rsquo;t follow,&rdquo; said Fawksull. &ldquo;To the northeast, I could see two yellow forms making straight for our ship. To the southeast, three more. And we had no more bread.</p><p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, off to the east...&rdquo;</p><p>He paused and swallowed, surprised at himself for feeling so strangely emotional, all these hundredturns later.</p><p>&ldquo;To the east,&rdquo; he said, his voice a little hoarse, &ldquo;I saw a tiny little brown bird, flying crookedly. It was struggling to stay in the air with a broken wing, and make it home.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>After a moment&rsquo;s pause to refill his cup and gather himself, Fawksull said to the captains, &ldquo;You know, <em>Hashtag&rsquo;s Guide to Water-Capables</em> mentions frequently that you can&rsquo;t use beam weapons on quakkens or other submarine units. The Shockmancy won&rsquo;t penetrate the surface of the water.&rdquo;</p><p>A couple of them nodded in assent.</p><p>&ldquo;So I could not shoot. And I could not move the ship. Which I must say, ah, limited my options,&rdquo; said the Governor wryly. &ldquo;At this point, I remember actually thinking about going below, putting on a white hat, and trying to bake some bread.&rdquo;<br /><br />There was laughter. At the time, Fawksull&mdash;Forecastle&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t been familiar with the process. But he&rsquo;d learned later that it took a full turn with crew units manning both ovens to bake barely enough bread to keep one quakken friendly.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Hashtag&rsquo;s</em> said I had only one real option left, and it wasn&rsquo;t a good one. But I called, &lsquo;all harpooners on deck!&rsquo; Then I stood at the rail, and watched my poor, crippled eagle try to outrace five angry quakkens.&rdquo;</p><p>Images of the moment flooded back to him: how broken and splintered his ship looked, and how much the deep slash in his side added to his weariness. His legs and his sword arm ached. He longed to sit down. Lay down. Fall down. Jump into the water and drown.</p><p>But the eagle had it worse than he did, and <em>it</em> was still fighting. In addition to its stiff, bent wing, one of its two heads appeared to be doing all of the flying. The other hung limp. He&rsquo;d cringed to see it flopping around with each agonizing wingbeat. As it came more fully into view, he could again see its stats: <strong>Hits: 1/20, Luckamancy Reserve: 0/30</strong></p><p>&ldquo;The race ended in a tie, effectively,&rdquo; continued the Governor. &ldquo;The pod of three feral quakkens reached us just before the eagle, and our friendly quakkens began to fight them, defending the ship. The poor bird alighted on the quarterdeck rail, ferociously wounded, but defiant. I wished I&rsquo;d had a fish to feed it, to give to its one alert and undamaged head.</p><p>&ldquo;But instead, I ordered it to curse all my harpooners but one. Gummel, who&rsquo;d helped me locate the porthole.</p><p>&ldquo;The other pair of quakkens were approaching from starboard. I had no way to tell the friendly ones from the unfriendlies, so I ordered all the pooners except Gummel to focus their throws against those two beasts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can imagine how <em>that</em> went,&rdquo; grunted Captain Eleven, whose dress blue uniform sported strangely wide lapels.</p><p>&ldquo;However you imagine it, Captain,&rdquo; said Fawksull, &ldquo;it was worse. Not a single harpoon even made it overboard. Two of the six pooners wounded <em>each other</em>. And the other wild harpoons ended up damaging the ship in small ways.</p><p>&ldquo;But that was all right, ultimately. Even <em>that </em>was a form of good luck. It allowed us to retrieve them to throw again! Meanwhile, the eagle&rsquo;s Luckamancy reserve had gone up to one...&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Admiral Harping&rsquo;s cadre of trusted officers had gathered themselves in the kitchen, of all places. Fawksull found them lurking in the near darkness, seated upon butcher&rsquo;s blocks and barrels of dried plums.</p><p>The Governor led them instead to the privacy of his sitting room, which was just outside his chamber of office, and had a lockable door on it. Eagle Keys didn&rsquo;t have many troops, or even servants, but with a Ruler&rsquo;s silent order he roused two pairs of stabbers out of the palace barracks and stationed them at either end of the outside hallway, to discourage the curious.</p><p>He hung a yellowish powerball in the corner, and lit some actual candles for good measure. There still wasn&rsquo;t much light in the wood-paneled room, but he decided against a fire in the hearth.</p><p>From his office, he retrieved a set of porcelain cups and a decanter of kava, and set it out on the low tea table. This wasn&rsquo;t a night for tea.</p><p>The captains muttered their introductions, but Fawksull had already met them before and during dinner. Cat Harping kept them subdued and in line, emplacing the four of them side by side on the leather sofa. She and the Governor took the overstuffed velvet chairs.</p><p>&ldquo;They know Chequer wasn&rsquo;t, uh...quite the man he&rsquo;s made out to be,&rdquo; Cat had said to him on the way to the kitchen, &ldquo;but please, Fawksull. Don&rsquo;t be disrespectful. He was a good Navy man. Remember that.&rdquo;</p><p>The captains, three men and one woman all with the salty, gaunt Signamancy of seafarer warlords, looked over the tea table at the Governor. They were still in their blue formals, sitting at attention, afraid to relax in front of the Admiral. Or maybe they were afraid of what he was going to say.</p><p>Fawksull&rsquo;s own Signamancy had softened a bit with the comfort and easy boredom of his present life, he knew. He leaned forward in his green velour dressing gown with his hands on his knees, and looked them over.</p><p>&ldquo;When they were getting ready to launch <em>Unsinkable II</em>,&rdquo; he began without preamble, &ldquo;I rode out from the city of Forecastle to pay my respects to the Admiralty and the Queen. At that time, I was the only non-seafarer warlord that Seaworld had, although I, uh...hear you&rsquo;ve gained a few more since then.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled, and a couple of the captains politely chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I certainly didn&rsquo;t <em>know</em> they planned to put me aboard her. I thought it was more likely I was going to be disbanded...&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>In Fawksull&rsquo;s head, his service with the Royal Navy had been compressed down to a few vivid images: his days of imprisonment in his cabin, the awkward, drunken meals with Chequer, climbing the rigging and taming the bird, seeing <em>Unsinkable II</em> slip below the waves, his first sight of the quakken below the water...</p><p>But in the telling of it, he somehow unpacked whole trunks full of particulars and details.</p><p>Cat helped him; she remembered many things he hadn&rsquo;t. Sometimes her recollection of events conflicted with his own, which made him wonder about the reliability of memory at all. It was disturbing how easy it was to forget things, to conflate details, to mix up the order of events, to misremember even what you yourself had said and done.</p><p>It took him most of the night to explain everything up through the big battle and the sinking of Her Majesty&rsquo;s flagship. The discovery of the double eagle&rsquo;s special, and how he&rsquo;d used it, seemed to baffle the captains. They couldn&rsquo;t make sense of the idea that the bird could be both a blessing <em>and</em> a curse, both good Luckamancy and bad.</p><p>&ldquo;How could it be a Seaworld unit, yet still curse you?&rdquo; said Captain Geech, a tan, angular man with white eyes. &ldquo;Its sense of Duty ought to prevent that. Shouldn&rsquo;t it only bring you good luck once you tamed it, and apply bad luck only to the enemy?&rdquo;</p><p>Fawksull shook his head. &ldquo;No. But I didn&rsquo;t really understand at the time, either. It took a game of dice to show me. But that came a bit later...&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>In the hour before dawn, he found his tiredness replaced by a strange sense of focus, as if he could view the past through a porthole, and simply describe what he saw there.</p><p>The captains&rsquo; questions had gradually stopped coming, but their attention never wavered. Even after so many hours, they still sat tensely at the edge of the sofa, their eyes upon the Governor as he described the game of bunco with Carrack, the crippling of <em>Double Eagle</em>, and the sinking of the Anchorbar man-o&rsquo;-war.</p><p>&ldquo;When I reached the main deck, I&rsquo;d gathered up a stack of eleven stabbers with me,&rdquo; said Fawksull. &ldquo;That was more than we needed to deal with the boarders. But it took us too much time. By the time we&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pah. It was barely <em>enough</em>, as I remember,&rdquo; interjected Cat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing down your part again, Fawksull. Your stack took down two dozen or more. And you were wounded.&rdquo; Several times now, the Admiral had accused him of minimizing his own role in the story.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t trying to be humble, Admiral,&rdquo; he said with a shrug. &ldquo;More the opposite, if you must know.&rdquo; Cat had been below and incapacitated at the time, but she was right; that sword fight had been the hardest and nastiest of his life.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just that he wasn&rsquo;t particularly proud of it. He gestured to his waist. &ldquo;I took a cut across the hip,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;One came at me from behind. I think it would have been a crit, but the eagle spent a point on me without my ordering it. I think that&rsquo;s what happened. Its Luck went down to seven, anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;But yes. We cleared the decks of more than a score of them, and lost five of our own.&rdquo;</p><p>Fawksull paused for a moment. He looked each of them in the eye, in turn.</p><p>The fact that they were ship&rsquo;s captains made a difference here. He knew they were picturing themselves in his place as they heard the tale, comparing their own ideas and their imagined decisions to his.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;that you all are beginning to see the terrible implications of the Luckamancy Reserve, for a commander.&rdquo;</p><p>They looked at him in respectful silence. A couple of them nodded, but he could see that they didn&rsquo;t get it. Not yet.</p><p>&ldquo;The eagle could have saved those stabbers as well,&rdquo; said Fawksull. &ldquo;I could have ordered it to do that. Instead, I let five units under my direct command perish.&rdquo; He straightened his back a bit, gesturing with his hands. &ldquo;When you lead your soldiers into a fight, you are trusting their lives and yours to Fate. But this was a different matter. It was <em>my</em> choice who lived, not the Titans&rsquo;, you see?&rdquo;</p><p>One by one, their faces went grim. Now they understood why he wasn&rsquo;t eager to recall this part of the story. Being a warlord in battle was a joy, something they had all been popped to do. But rigging the dice, fixing your people&rsquo;s fates as if you were a Titan...that was perhaps a heavier burden than they were ever meant to shoulder.</p><p>Nodding once, he took in a deep breath, and cleared his throat. &ldquo;By this time, we had a small barque right alongside us, hooking in. Again, to port. Our wounded side. She saw the fight on deck, so she didn&rsquo;t fire her beams. Didn&rsquo;t want to sink us with Anchormen aboard. She only meant to send in more blades, to aid the capture. Behind her, I could see their other ships were breaking formation, closing in on us.&rdquo;</p><p>Fawksull leaned forward and made a wry face. &ldquo;The, ah, lubber warlord on the barque&rsquo;s quarterdeck was so obvious that I almost took him for a decoy. He was in <em>chain mail</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, and the tension in the room loosened a bit. The Seaworld captains shook their heads at one another and chuckled. Wearing armor aboard a ship guaranteed that you would drown, if you ever ended up in the water. Only a &ldquo;Forecastle&rdquo; would do that.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t worry about stealth at this point, so I ordered the bird to fly in and grab him, using its reserve special as needed. He had a mace, and he didn&rsquo;t hesitate to swing it, but the eagle captured him anyway. That brought its Luckamancy down to five, though, so I suppose he <em>would</em> have hit it, and resisted the capture attempt.&rdquo;</p><p>There were nods among the captains. Cat remained silent, watching them. The Governor took an absent sip of kava, and set his teacup back on its saucer.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m still amazed at how <em>quickly</em> the barque disappeared, after the prisoner was aboard. It seemed that I only turned around to order the armored man taken below, and the ship was utterly gone. I had to run to the port rail to see that she&rsquo;d keeled over. Her masts were lying in the water, and she was still in the process of being holed by our <em>three</em>,&rdquo; he held up three fingers, &ldquo;friendly quakkens.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled, recalling the tinny sound of a distant ship&rsquo;s bell, carried by the ocean breeze. &ldquo;There were two ships in beam range of us by then, both of them three-masters, both a little bigger than <em>Double Eagle</em>. With only five points of Luckamancy left, all they had to do was to fire on us. But you know...they panicked. They sounded general alarm and hove to, signaling &lsquo;converge&rsquo; and &lsquo;cease fire.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Cat snorted. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know those were the signals at the <em>time</em>. I&rsquo;d bet you still don&rsquo;t read numerary flags.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Fawksull nodded, &ldquo;I just saw them regrouping. I took the opportunity to fire six or seven more wild volleys, while the Anchorbar ships pulled themselves into a tight formation. I got the eagle&rsquo;s luck back up to around eighteen, I believe. Maybe nineteen.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, they knew we weren&rsquo;t going anywhere. But they had also seen us sink two of theirs in rapid succession. And I don&rsquo;t know if they knew about the eagle even by <em>that</em> point, but they could see we had three quakkens, and they didn&rsquo;t want to approach us. So they huddled close together, and kept their beams aimed our way. They likely had a conference of some sort among the leadership.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I took full advantage of the delay, and I was beginning to think they would just let us keep firing until I&rsquo;d filled up the eagle&rsquo;s reserve all the way to thirty. But suddenly they let loose blasted us, all at once. Just a blinding, scorching volley of Shockmancy that sent crackles of light crawling through the rigging.&rdquo;</p><p>He could picture it still, but he lacked adequate words to describe it. &ldquo;Strange sight. We were unharmed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but alarmingly, the eagle&rsquo;s Luck now stood at six.&rdquo;</p><p>The captains shifted uncomfortably. One of them let out a little involuntary grunt.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Fawksull. &ldquo;To them, it still appeared we had gone unscathed. But one more such volley would sink us. And the fact remained that we were blasted to pieces, with our foremast gone. We <em>looked</em> vulnerable, and they would certainly want to try a few more times before giving up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; asked Captain Chesapeake, the round-faced man at the far end of the sofa.</p><p>Fawksull shrugged helplessly. &ldquo;Attacked. With our only weapon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I sent the eagle at them.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Duke Forecastle - Part 21]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Epilogue - Colony of Eagle Keys - 1621 Turns Since the Battle of the Storm Hex</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p><p>Eagle&rsquo;s Gift mostly sat high over the water, atop an imposing peninsula of white cliffs and tumbled rock. The city harbor formed a long finger of blue sea which poked into the island, on a parallel with the ocean. The streets of the city above were connected to the shipyard and docks below by seven enormous, rock-hewn staircases leading down the cliff face.</p><p>As colonial capitals went, this was an average-looking Level 2. Its humble limestone towers and squat, clay-roofed buildings were accented with the green of olive trees and vegetable gardens. But it boasted some spiffy terrain bonuses from those sea cliffs. And an array of six fireball catapults, emplaced along the seaward side to the east and at the southeastern point, also helped to keep the Anchormen from mounting a serious landing here. Twice since its founding, Eagle&rsquo;s Gift had proven it could defend its shores.</p><p>Governor Fawksull was not facing the seaward side now. He was leaning over the stone railing of the ballroom balcony, looking down upon the harbor, shaking his head in wonder. Nineteen ships of Her Majesty&rsquo;s First Expeditionary Fleet stood at anchor. A few yellow blotches moved beneath the shadows of their hulls. But his eyes were fixed upon one small frigate, nestled in among the bigger craft.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <em>Double Eagle</em>,&rdquo; he told Henley and Felder, who were the dons of Eagle Keys&rsquo; other two cities, and his colony&rsquo;s only two warlords. They&rsquo;d made the trip from their home islands to pay their respects to the Royal Navy, but they didn&rsquo;t seem too terribly interested in it. Neither one of them was a seafarer.</p><p>The Governor grinned and pointed, anyway. &ldquo;That one. See it? Wow. She really brought her.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>When the fleet officers had been announced and admitted, Fawksull waited four precise and proper beats, then rose from his seat of office. To either side of him, the dons were already standing. Five crisp forms led the way over the olive green carpet, approaching, in flawless lock-step, the platform that he and his warlords stood upon. The officer at the point of the little wedge formation called a halt, and shouted boisterously up to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Governor Forecastle! As emissary and servant to Her Majesty, Queen Eliteabit of Seaworld, I bring you Her Majesty&rsquo;s felicitations and blessings.&rdquo; The Admiral bowed low. &ldquo;May we come ashore?&rdquo;</p><p>Fawksull stared at the gold-emblazoned, blue frock coat of her uniform. Her white boots had a mirror shine, just like Chequer&rsquo;s black ones used to. She looked taller, leaner, more commanding than he remembered.</p><p>It was so deeply strange, formally receiving Cat at his palace this way.</p><p>She&rsquo;d been his navigator, his connection to the ship, and his only friend when he was facing the most awful and perilous times of his life. But here they were now, a Governor and an Admiral. There were formalities expected, of course&mdash;asking for permission to come ashore when they were already here, and such. He didn&rsquo;t much care for them, but these turns <em>she</em> might, so he would play his part in the ceremony.</p><p>&ldquo;Admiral Harping!&rdquo; he bellowed back, a hair louder than she had. &ldquo;As Governor of Eagle Keys and Master of the City, and as a subject of Her Royal Majesty as well, I do grant you and your units of the glorious and peerless Royal Navy of Seaworld complete and unrestricted liberty within our borders, for the duration of your stay! Welcome back! And it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fawksull&rsquo; now!&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;d kept a blank and professionally indifferent commander&rsquo;s face on, but when he blurted out this last bit, her stomach gave a little buckle and she snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Ff&mdash;what?&rdquo; she said, breaking into one of those toothy grins that he&rsquo;d spent so many hours trying to earn from her, while on watch. &ldquo;Is it really?&rdquo;</p><p>The Governor let his tone fall back to informal. &ldquo;Admiral Chequer said it that way, if you&rsquo;ll recall,&rdquo; he said with a sly, sad little grin of his own. &ldquo;So. Surely it must be right...&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>Her flagship was <em>HMS Nelson Chequer</em>, of course. There was no avoiding that fact, and everything that it stood for.</p><p>Cat Harping had gone home to Seaworld as captain of <em>Double Eagle</em>, and Fawksull had stayed here. She might have told the Admiralty the whole tale, or parts of it, or maybe none of it. Perhaps she&rsquo;d made something up.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t matter, as Fawksull figured it. The Admiralty made no heroes out of cowards and defectors. As far as Seaworld was concerned, Nelson Chequer had gallantly given his life to uncover Anchorbar&rsquo;s secrets at the Battle of the Storm Hex. The Admiral had discovered the quakkens and their method of taming them, which put Seaworld and Anchorbar back on an even war footing. The war raged on, but Eliteabit was no longer in danger of losing her empire.</p><p>As for the current Governor of Eagle Keys, he was the comic relief of the tale, the seasick lubber who had bunged everything up by attracting a cursed double eagle to the Admiral&rsquo;s flagship and then taming it. He was the one who&rsquo;d gotten the Admiral croaked, and escaped from the fight by running away in terror.</p><p>Then, out of sheer dumb luck, he had managed to discover an unclaimed capital site on his way home.</p><p>Indeed (or so went the opinion of the Admiralty), defecting and founding a new side was the only thing the mudfoot could have done to avoid a court martial and disbandment. And only by declaring Eagle Keys a colony of Seaworld had he avoided being conquered since. For so long as it pleased the Crown that he do so, the Governor would remain a minor embarrassment in an otherwise glorious tale of triumph. &ldquo;Fate protects a fool,&rdquo; was the simple moral of his story.</p><p>The quakken-taming, non-seafarer units now attached to the crew of most Royal Navy ships were pejoratively called &ldquo;Forecastle&rdquo; (as was anyone who did or said something foolish aboard ship). The Forecastles were reminded every day to stay out of the crew&rsquo;s way, unless they were feeding the quakken. And never, ever, under any circumstances, were they to feed a double eagle, should a ship find itself cursed with one.</p><p>Fawksull knew this, and his heart went out to them. But that was the Royal Navy.</p><p>Nor had his own humiliation from them ended with his service. It was, as Fate would have it, his formal obligation and duty as Governor to host a banquet for all the fleet officers on their first night in port.</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>Meeting the actual &ldquo;Forecastle&rdquo; of legend, the one whose buffoonery had almost cost the Queen her greatest triumph, was a rare treat for the puffed-up little captains and commodores. From every table, the thirty or so fleet officers took their turns one-upping each other. Their jests and barbs barely stayed within the bounds of proper etiquette. But that was part of the game, and the Colonial Governor politely smiled his way through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you think that &lsquo;Eagle Keys&rsquo; and &lsquo;Eagle&rsquo;s Gift&rsquo; would be <em>lucky</em> names, Governor?&rdquo; asked one chub-cheeked, muttonchopped rear admiral who was seated at his own table, monopolizing the conversation. &ldquo;Like <em>Double Eagle</em>?&rdquo;</p><p>There were laughs, and Fawksull grunted. The frigate&rsquo;s name was one reason he had been surprised to see his former ship among the fleet. As far as he&rsquo;d heard tell, the ship had stayed in port at Seaworld ever since her arrival there, over fifteen hundredturns ago. She was viewed with a certain reverence for history, so they refused to rename her. But no-one wanted to crew or command that ship. No-one wanted her to sail as part of their fleet. Titans, who would <em>intentionally</em> set sail with a <em>Double Eagle</em>?</p><p>The Governor applied a knife to his lobster tail and carved out a morsel of meat. &ldquo;Luckier for land, than for sea, I&rsquo;d imagine,&rdquo; he smiled politely.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me. Do you ever <em>see</em> any eagles here in Eagle Keys?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;Oh, yes. Occasionally. We think that they pop on the smaller keys, when no unit is around to observe them. Then they fly off to sea.&rdquo; He glanced at Cat with the same affected smile. &ldquo;You should be cautious about staying too long, Admiral. You might attract one.&rdquo;</p><p>This comment quieted the dining room considerably.</p><p>To that point in the evening, Cat had said about as little as was required of her. But now she raised her wine glass and drained it of burgundy, and eyed him with a trace of a sneer. &ldquo;If that happens, Governor, then I suppose I&rsquo;ll invite you down to the <em>Chequer</em> to feed it.&rdquo;</p><p>The table erupted in laughter, and Fawksull forced himself to chuckle along.</p><p>Cat smirked around at her captains, holding up her glass for a steward behind her to refill. &ldquo;Ya wouldn&rsquo;t mind climbing the mainmast with a bucket, I&rsquo;m sure. Right? You used to love to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Cat swigged more wine, as another bout of laughs followed. She set down her glass.</p><p>&ldquo;So yes, Governor <em>Fawk</em>-sull, if we attract one of your birds, then I&rsquo;ll be counting on <em>you</em> to take it off our hands. Make it an Eagle Keys unit.&rdquo; She leaned toward him and gave him a wicked grin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll solve <em>that</em> matter, don&rsquo;tcha think?&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>His face hurt from forcing himself to laugh and smile all evening.</p><p>Fawksull unlaced his boots, sitting on the edge of his grandiose bed. Its absurd comfort (compared to anywhere he ever slept, on a ship or otherwise), and the incipient bliss of unconsciousness were the only things that could genuinely make him smile right now. Soon, he would be asleep. Soon, the fleet would depart. Soon, Cat Harping would be gone.</p><p>For all these hundredturns, he&rsquo;d told himself that it didn&rsquo;t matter. It didn&rsquo;t matter that she&rsquo;d sailed home, that she had refused to turn, that she wouldn&rsquo;t live here with him and help the colony grow. That was her life, and she had gone where her Duty took her.</p><p>Above all, he&rsquo;d told himself that it didn&rsquo;t matter whether or not she had told the Admiralty the truth about the battle. She knew, and he knew, and the Titans knew. As long as they were both alive in the world, that was enough for him.</p><p>But she had been so disbanded unkind tonight. This person wasn&rsquo;t the Cat Harping he remembered.</p><p>And now, of course, he knew. She <em>had</em> lied. She must have.</p><p>And it <em>did</em> matter. Perhaps it changed nothing about his life, but somehow it very much mattered to him. She&rsquo;d gone home and told Queen Eliteabit and the highest officers of the Royal Navy that Chequer had won the fight, and that she had helped him, despite the ineptitude of &ldquo;Forecastle.&rdquo; For that, they had first made her a captain, then a commodore, then a rear admiral. And now, she commanded the largest fleet in the Royal Navy.</p><p>Yes. It mattered.</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>Despite the wine and his exhaustion, unconsciousness came reluctantly. And when it finally arrived, it didn&rsquo;t stay for long.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t knock like an admiral, or even like the gruff, no-nonsense navigator he once had known. The rapping at his door was soft, but insistent. It must have gone on for a long time before he awoke. And it was still going on as he opened the door, standing in his nightshirt with his stockinged feet on his thick pile rug.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, Admiral?&rdquo; he said in a low whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;Need to talk,&rdquo; she said. Her face was in shadows, her voice soft and conspiratorial. She was still in her formal uniform from the banquet. &ldquo;I need to ask you something. For a favor, I suppose.&rdquo;</p><p>He rubbed his eyelids with thumb and forefinger. &ldquo;Um. Can it wait until morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Fawksull,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head, but not to say no, only to clear out the sleep. He motioned her inside, and closed and latched the door behind her.</p><p>They stood there looking at one another in the light of a single powerball he had uncovered after waking.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked her after a while.</p><p>&ldquo;Fawksull, the Navy...&rdquo; She breathed out through her nose and gave a humorless smile. &ldquo;You remember the Royal Navy, right?&rdquo;</p><p>He only stared at her.</p><p>&ldquo;The Navy&rsquo;s the Navy,&rdquo; she said, sounding tense. &ldquo;You remember. We do things a certain way. It&rsquo;s not always right, I know. It&rsquo;s not always smart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not always honest,&rdquo; added Fawksull, surprising himself with the bluntness of it after an evening of forced politeness.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; the Admiral admitted at once. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rarely that. That&rsquo;s what I mean.&rdquo; She blinked a couple of times at him. &ldquo;The, um...part you played tonight, Fawksull. You did it really well.&rdquo;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure what she meant by that. &ldquo;...Thanks?&rdquo; he ventured sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if you were going to stick to the story or not. That&rsquo;s what I mean about the Navy; that&rsquo;s <em>their</em> story. It&rsquo;s the Queen&rsquo;s story. They&rsquo;re commissioning an epic. So we have to keep it going. It&rsquo;s important. More important than you are,&rdquo; she looked away for a moment, then met his eyes. &ldquo;But I guess I never had a chance to apologize for that, Fawksull. You deserved better.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened his palm and gestured at the lavish quarters he now occupied. &ldquo;I can hardly complain about my circumstances, Cat.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;You earned this, Fawksull. But it&rsquo;s not about where we ended up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A lot of units who were better than either of us wound up at the bottom of the sea. Justice is the Titan&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; She sighed tensely. &ldquo;This is about the truth. There&rsquo;s the Navy...and then there&rsquo;s the truth. You know what I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t help giving her a sardonic little half-chuckle. &ldquo;Well <em>that</em> much is true. For all the power that the truth has, anyway...&rdquo;</p><p>She reached out and grabbed his wrist. Her hands were strong, but chill. She was nervous. He didn&rsquo;t remember ever seeing her this way.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got power,&rdquo; she whispered urgently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got too <em>much </em>power. Not everyone can come to grips with it. That&rsquo;s why the Navy needs its stories. But it needs the truth, too. Or we lose whole fleets, whole wars. You <em>know </em>that, Fawksull.&rdquo;</p><p>Even in the dark, the look she was giving him burned with intensity. She had never spoken like this under Admiral Chequer&rsquo;s command, either.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want, Cat?&rdquo; he asked her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the favor?&rdquo;</p><p>She let go of his wrist. &ldquo;I came far out of our way to be here for it. Thirty turns or more. You&rsquo;d better say yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Fawksull suddenly stiffened.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Cat. I&rsquo;m not going to sea again. Not for any reason. If that&rsquo;s why you brought <em>Double</em>&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No-no!&rdquo; She held up both hands hastily. &ldquo;No, I would never ask you that. I know better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; he said, wrinkling his brow. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>She took a step away from him and looked off to a corner of the room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know all of my captains, yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know some of the ones I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> trust. And I know just a few that I do. Before we take this fleet into battle, I need the ones I trust to hear what <em>really</em> happened at Stormy.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes now snapped into a distant focus, looking somewhere over his shoulder. This was the competent, piercing stare of a ship&rsquo;s captain, scanning the horizon.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good people, Fawksull. And if <em>I&rsquo;m</em> any good at fleet command, then they&rsquo;re going to <em>be</em> the Admiralty someday,&rdquo; she told him with confidence. &ldquo;Maybe if that happens, then the Navy won&rsquo;t need so many stories.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Duke Forecastle - Part 20]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>He felt the wounds to his ship before he was aware of his own physical circumstances. Forecastle could sense that the remainder of the foremast was gone now, as were significant portions of the main. The rudder and tiller were smashed and useless. There was a small fire in the aft furnace. The hull was breached in three places along the port side.</p><p>And two thirds of <em>Double Eagle</em>&rsquo;s crew now lay croaked or incapacitated.</p><p>Carrack, he knew for certain, was lost. He&rsquo;d seen it happen. A section of the quarterdeck rail had flown off and struck him in the back, snapping the first mate&rsquo;s spine like a branch, and throwing his broken body over the command post to slam the captain backwards onto the deck.</p><p>The sounds Forecastle could hear made no sense to him yet, so he opened his eyes. He found himself lying flat on his back, looking up at the eagle on the cross-jack yard.</p><p>Looking at its points was a new habit he couldn&rsquo;t break: <strong>Special: Luckamancy Reserve - capacity: 10/30</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Titans, bird,&rdquo; he gasped out, &ldquo;what did you do?&rdquo;</p><p>He got himself up on his elbows and blinked in the midday sunlight, looking around. Carrack&rsquo;s body lay beside him, facing away. Pieces of everything were everywhere.</p><p>He rose and stood on his feet, feeling distant and isolated. His brain felt clouded, numb, but his limbs and his eyes worked well enough. Apparently, the explosion had left him physically unharmed.</p><p>The sounds he&rsquo;d been hearing before now resolved themselves into despondent shouts and pleas. The practiced, competent rhythm of the deck hands and riggers had unraveled into chaos in the catastrophe. Was he the only officer left standing? So it seemed.</p><p>Forecastle could see that the quarter and main decks were strewn with splintered wood and sailcloth, and the bodies of his sailors. Tangled lines and torn sails hung from the mainmast. The mizzen looked intact, but the foremast, broken at the root, hung over the port side, dangling its sails and ropes into the water. A few heads bobbed in the waves there.</p><p>The missing sails and rigging afforded him a clear view of the agent of his ship&rsquo;s destruction. The Anchorbar man-o&rsquo;-war must have fired a full broadside, raking <em>Double Eagle</em> from stem to stern, every shot a direct hit. She was tacking for a second volley, and looked about ready to fire again.</p><p>&ldquo;Bunco,&rdquo; he said. It came out in a soft sigh.</p><p>The bird above him cawed, and he looked up at it angrily. &ldquo;Yes! Bunco! Curse <em>us</em>, don&rsquo;t bless <em>them</em>! What were you thinking? We needed this ship!&rdquo;</p><p>His plan had been to fight the Anchorbar ships and surprise them, taking them out one by one. But now<em> Double Eagle</em> was croaked in the water. They could not maneuver, and there was little reason for the enemy to close with them. The Anchormen only had to fire their beams a time or two to finish the job, and that&rsquo;s just what they were preparing to do.</p><p>He put his hands on his hips and blew out a long breath, looking down the length of his crippled ship. He could feel its distress: the punctures and fractures, the smoldering fire, the seawater leaking in.</p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said, perhaps to the bird, perhaps to the Titans, &ldquo;the worst captain imaginable. I should not be here. But the Duty is mine. I won&rsquo;t give up my ship. We&rsquo;ll fight them with what we have left.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned and looked up at the eagle, perched on the yard above him. For once, both its heads were looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;And what we have is you,&rdquo; said Forecastle, his anger hardening into resolve. &ldquo;Listen to me now. I order you <em>not</em> to fill your Luckamancy reserve by <em>blessing</em> the enemy any more. No more buncos, you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>One of the eagle&rsquo;s heads dipped, almost apologetically.</p><p>&ldquo;In fact, protect us. Spend your luck to make sure we are not hit again, and keep us afloat,&rdquo; said the captain. The bird stretched out one wing, and preened its feathers a bit. He wasn&rsquo;t certain it had understood the order, but then he felt a strange coolness, in a spot he couldn&rsquo;t identify. He realized that the fire in the furnace room had been extinguished.</p><p>The eagle&rsquo;s Luckamancy Reserve now said: <strong>9/30</strong>.</p><p>&ldquo;Good bird. Smart bird,&rdquo; he told it, speaking clearly and slowly. &ldquo;All the same, though, I still need you to <em>curse</em> us. Like you did my dice rolls. I am going to fire the beams now. You make sure we can&rsquo;t hit a thing. Fill up your reserves on <em>that</em>. All right?&rdquo;</p><p>The eagle opened a beak and showed him a pink tongue. He took it as an &ldquo;aye-aye,&rdquo; and turned around to look for any of the crew who&rsquo;d be willing and able enough to follow an order.</p><p>Not one of the sailors had approached him for aid or instruction, or to report. They ignored the quarterdeck and worked on their own, putting what minor things they could back together again.</p><p>There were some units up in the main and mizzen rigging. He&rsquo;d never been on deck when the beams were fired, and he didn&rsquo;t know which crewmen were responsible for it, so he just stood there like a braying mule and shouted his order to the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Fire our beams at the near ship! Now!&rdquo; He pointed at the man-o&rsquo;-war with an outstretched arm, just to make it clear to anyone who might heed him. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p><p>A long moment passed. Then someone high above him shouted, &ldquo;Sight nigh enemy vessel, aye, Captain! Light port beams, aye! Fire at will, aye-aye!&rdquo;</p><p>He waited a few moments more, watching the man-o&rsquo;-war. She didn&rsquo;t move or turn, and her yards were perfectly aligned on the <em>Eagle</em>. He wondered what they might be waiting for. He wondered how long it would take for the remaining crew to&mdash;</p><p>The bolts of Shockmancy arced out in all directions from <em>Double Eagle</em>: skyward, into the water, perpendicular to the ship in a way he didn&rsquo;t even know they could be shot. Four beams from the mizzen and two from the mangled main were fired, and not one was even <em>close</em> to the target.</p><p>He heard groans from some of the sailors on deck which had nothing to do with their wounds, but this was just the result he&rsquo;d wanted. He glanced at the bird&rsquo;s points:</p><p><strong>Special: Luckamancy Reserve - capacity: 11/30</strong></p><p>Two points gained! Perhaps, then, the eagle had stolen the luck from two of their shots, which would otherwise have hit the man-o&rsquo;-war.</p><p>&ldquo;Brilliant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Brilliant! That&rsquo;s it, bird! That&rsquo;s it! Spend it to make them miss, if you have to, but let&rsquo;s keep filling you up.&rdquo; He cupped his hand to his mouth and shouted up into the mizzen rigging, to whichever rigger had followed his order. &ldquo;Prepare to fire again! Fire at will, same target!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Light for beam volley, aye, Cap&rsquo;n! Fire at will, aye!&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>The frigate and the man-o&rsquo;-war sat there in the water, slugging it out with three more broadsides. Beams from the Anchorbar battleship sliced through the air between the sails, or struck the water harmlessly, but <em>Double Eagle</em> took no more hits.</p><p>Forecastle kept his eye on the bird&rsquo;s Luckamancy Reserve. This immunity from fire had cost it eight points of luck, but it gained back five on the Seaworld ship&rsquo;s laughable attempts to return fire. Shockmancy bolts flew off everywhere but toward the enemy.</p><p>The two vessels were, in effect, throwing dice. But the frigate was losing, because the man-o&rsquo;-war had more masts, and therefore more rolls.</p><p>The other ships of the Anchormen fleet had now turned as a pack, to jump into the fight. This action was buying a little time, but it would not save Forecastle&rsquo;s ship. All the man-o&rsquo;-war had to do was to keep shooting, and eventually the bird&rsquo;s luck would run out.</p><p>The Anchormen, however, didn&rsquo;t know that.</p><p>Perhaps it was the frustration of so many misses, or the pride of the man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s captain in wanting to claim the final victory, or the fact that with her critical damage and wildly malfunctioning weapons, <em>HMS Double Eagle</em> seemed to be no threat...but the enemy warship trimmed her sails and turned with the wind, aiming to engage.</p><p>&ldquo;Bird...&rdquo; said Forecastle at the broken command post, &ldquo;hop up through the sails now. Don&rsquo;t let them spot you.&rdquo;</p><p>The eagle made no sound, but sidestepped along the cross-jack yard and eased around the mizzen mast, with spread wings. Then, with a few careful flaps, it heaved itself up to the mizzen topsail.</p><p>&ldquo;Let it pass you!&rdquo; he called to the mostly unseen riggers. &ldquo;Ignore it. Fire the beams on the approaching vessel!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, Cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo;</p><p>The next volley went as wild as the others, and was even more improbable for how close their target now was. The approaching man-o&rsquo;-war was rigged to grapple, with hook-swinging sailors lined up at the bow and along the rails. She looked much the way <em>Unsinkable II</em> must have appeared to the Anchorbar crew of this ship, just an hour or so ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he shouted to his deck crew. Most of them were busy at repair, though some were forming up for combat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not likely to believe a disbanded word I say, I know it!&rdquo; That made a few of them throw him a wary or disgusted look. &ldquo;But we can win this fight! Don&rsquo;t bother with arms at all, just throw off the hooks! Resist the grapple!&rdquo;</p><p>He received a few disconsolate &ldquo;aye&rdquo;s in reply to his order. Most of the stabbers sheathed their swords.</p><p>The man-o&rsquo;-war was in fine fettle, and excellently crewed. She approached from astern, deftly pulling alongside the stricken frigate on her damaged port side, looming over by a deck and a half. The unseen enemy sailors shouted out, and hooks cascaded onto <em>Eagle</em>&rsquo;s decks from above.</p><p>From the quarterdeck, the captain could see only a wall of painted hardwood boards, with angry faces in the shadows of her open ports. He did not know if the enemy&rsquo;s quakken might attack, or if it would fight with their own below the water. But as yet, he&rsquo;d heard no thumps.</p><p>Forecastle looked up. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he ordered.</p><p>The eagle&rsquo;s position in the mizzen topsail yard must have been just a few feet above eye level for the man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s command deck. With a chilling double screech, it dove out of the sails. He heard shouts, and more screeching, from the enemy ship&rsquo;s decks above.</p><p>Risking a look, Forecastle ran to the port side rail and tried to see the fight, but the battleship was too tall, and <em>Double Eagle</em> was sitting low in the water now, anyway. Something was happening up there, but all he could see was the quarterdeck gunwale of the enemy ship.</p><p>His orders to the bird would have been simple for any soldier or sailor: <em>Find the one that&rsquo;s not afraid of you. Whichever one doesn&rsquo;t flinch and tries to engage you, capture and retrieve him. Use all the Luckamancy you need, to ensure success.</em> For a beast unit, that was a terrible lot to comprehend. He just didn&rsquo;t know if the eagle was capable of understanding it.</p><p>The engagement dragged on, with no sign of anything at all. At one point, a pronged hook dropped down beside Forecastle and snagged on the railing he was leaning on. He drew his sword and hacked at the line until it snapped.</p><p>Along the length of the port side, his sailors were doing the same thing to an overwhelming number of other lines that were snagged on spars and in the rigging. But gangplanks were already being lowered. There would soon be enemy units aboard. He looked up again to watch for any more falling hooks.</p><p>...and saw the eagle dragging a struggling body over the battleship&rsquo;s railing!</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Smart</em> bird! Pretty bird!&rdquo; shouted Captain Forecastle. &ldquo;Bring him aboard!&rdquo;</p><p>He turned on his heels and took off for the companionway steps. To nobody in particular, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be below!&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>The captain stood in the dim green light, watching with wonder as the great wooden warship rolled away into the murky depths. A few of the Anchormen escaped like bubbles from the cracks in her, as she sank. They kicked and swam desperately for the surface, almost certainly doomed.</p><p>Forecastle turned away from the porthole. He couldn&rsquo;t watch. He had been there.</p><p>This battle was still going on. Despite the loss of their own ship, some enemy boarders had made it onto <em>Double Eagle</em>&rsquo;s decks. He was going to have to find a stack of stabbers to lead. And of course, the rest of the Anchorbar fleet was approaching fast behind. The chance that he and the last of his crew would survive the day remained small.</p><p>But when you can swap the dice, a small chance was all you needed, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>He leaned, exhausted, against the wall of the little porthole closet. For a moment, he closed his eyes and played back through the battle in his mind.</p><p>Like the fight for <em>Unsinkable II</em>, this one had been won below the waves. But this time, the bigger ship had <em>two</em> quakkens attacking it. It went from pristine condition to sunken wreck in moments.</p><p>The quakkens were not tame. That was true. You couldn&rsquo;t give them orders. But they were protective, and more importantly, responsive. They were drawn to the focus of your attention. If you looked at an enemy ship and saw it as a threat to your own, then they would attack it. And they would hit it where you most wanted them to.</p><p>All for the promise of more loaves of bread.</p><p>As he had guessed, the second quakken wanted to protect the ship its &ldquo;friend&rdquo; was aboard. But you didn&rsquo;t need to <em>be</em> the quakken&rsquo;s friend to direct it. You just needed to be the captain of that ship.</p><p>He would try to repeat this trick, of course. The bird still had more luck, and they could refill it by firing. He hoped to grab several more prisoners, and their little yellow friends.</p><p>But even if they couldn&rsquo;t, even if the bird was lost, the two quakkens now defending <em>Double Eagle</em> ought to be able to stand up to any ship with one. It would be an interesting fight.</p><p>He closed the porthole cover, stepped out of the little booth, and drew his sword.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Carrack did not, in fact, have a deck of cards handy. But he produced three bone-colored dice from a suede coin purse in the pocket of his frock coat.</p><p>Forecastle took the dice from his first mate&rsquo;s hand and dropped down to his knees on the bare wooden deck. &ldquo;Your coins, too,&rdquo; he said, seeing that Carrack was putting his purse away. The captain slapped the planks with an open palm. &ldquo;Come on. Get down here, we&rsquo;re playing bunco.&rdquo; He put it in the form of an order, to avoid an argument.</p><p>Carrack made a quick, skeptical glance in the direction of the Anchorbar man-o&rsquo;-war, now looming into beam range. &ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He knelt beside Forecastle at the corner of the command post platform, emptied the purse into his hand, and showed his silver and bronze coins. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got sixty.&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Coins, a fabricated nonmagical currency, were collected and spent as a mark of status among enlisted units. They were not generally an item that warlords used, but most of Her Majesty&rsquo;s officers carried a pouch of them to disburse to underlings as rewards for exceptional performance or behavior. (Not every side controlled their coinage this way; some rulers didn&rsquo;t even allow coins at all.) Forecastle had carried a pouch with him when he&rsquo;d boarded <em>Unsinkable II</em>, but they&rsquo;d gone to the bottom of the ocean still secured in his desk drawer.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Carrack, offering his fistful of coins to Forecastle.</p><p>The captain shook his head, and waved the hand away. &ldquo;On second thought, it should be <em>real</em> stakes, I think. Something we care about.&rdquo;</p><p>Carrack stared at him blankly.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean...all right, if you lose, then you have to feed and groom my eagle for ten turns.&rdquo; He pointed upward. &ldquo;And be kind to it.&rdquo;</p><p>The first mate glanced up at the bird on the cross-jack yard, and made a sour face. &ldquo;Aye, n&rsquo; what if I win?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, um...&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle was at a loss. He looked around for something he could offer as compensation. A lot of the crew were standing around and staring at the two of them on their knees. He didn&rsquo;t care to think about the picture they must be painting.</p><p>What could he bet...? It was utterly stupid to let such a trivial detail stop this experiment&mdash;which was itself fairly stupid and desperate&mdash;but he really could not think of a thing to offer.</p><p>At that point, though, Carrack got a sudden, mean glint in his eye. &ldquo;If you lose, Cap&rsquo;n...&rdquo; he said, leaning forward, &ldquo;if you lose, then <em>you</em> have to climb the main mast and sing, &lsquo;Titans Save the Queen!&rsquo; Standin&rsquo; up, on the topgallant yard! With no hands!&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle&rsquo;s eyes went wide and he blanched, as he tried (but failed) not to picture it. &ldquo;Fine. It&rsquo;s a bet,&rdquo; he said, before he could change his mind.</p><p>He shot a glance up at the eagle and silently ordered it to curse his luck. <em>Curse my luck. Make me lose</em>, he silently ordered. Then he bent forward and rolled the dice.</p><p>They tumbled on the command platform, and came up <strong>3-4-2</strong>.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Forecastle. He passed the dice.</p><p>Carrack cautiously picked them up and rolled them in front of him. <strong>1-1-1</strong> was the result.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! Bunco!&rdquo; he laughed nervously.</p><p>The captain nodded. &ldquo;Right. Twenty-one to nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>He picked up the dice and rolled: <strong>4-1-3</strong>. &ldquo;Nm-nm.&rdquo; Shaking his head, he passed the dice to the first officer.</p><p>Carrack rolled a <strong>2-2-2</strong>. &ldquo;Bunco,&rdquo; he said again. But this time he didn&rsquo;t laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Forty-two to zero,&rdquo; said Forecastle, as he swept up the dice. He threw: <strong>1-2-4</strong>.</p><p>Carrack now looked him in the eye with an expression of vague dread, as he took up the dice and shook them in his hand for an extra moment, before rolling a <strong>3-3-3</strong>. &ldquo;Bunco,&rdquo; he said, without a trace of joy in it.</p><p>Captain Forecastle retrieved the dice again, and glanced back at the bird. Its points said:<br /><br /><strong>Special: Luckamancy Reserve - capacity: 4/30</strong><br /><br />It had gained no new Luckamancy, despite clear evidence that the curse on his luck was in effect.</p><p>He shook the dice in his hand, still looking at the unit. He had a guess as to what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Bird,&rdquo; he said to it, &ldquo;I said curse <em>me</em>; don&rsquo;t bless <em>him</em>. Take all my good rolls for yourself. Don&rsquo;t spend them on bettering his luck, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>One of the double eagle&rsquo;s heads put its beak in the air haughtily, while the other one squawked at him with a tilt-headed expression that he would have taken for condescension in any human unit.</p><p>&ldquo;Fours,&rdquo; said Forecastle to Carrack. He rolled, and got: <strong>1-3-1</strong>.</p><p>Carrack, having watched the exchange, looked at the Captain quizzically as he picked up the dice and took his turn. This time, he did not roll a bunco. His roll was: <strong>6-4-2</strong>.</p><p>&ldquo;Four points,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;So, what...forty-two...sixty-three, plus four. It&rsquo;s sixty-seven to nothing.&rdquo; Forecastle took up the dice and checked the eagle&rsquo;s points again. Stubbornly, it said:<br /><br /><strong>Special: Luckamancy Reserve - capacity: 4/30</strong><br /><br />He shook his head. &ldquo;Maybe we have to finish the game, or it doesn&rsquo;t count,&rdquo; he wondered aloud.</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, Cap&rsquo;n. Even if you bunco out, you can&rsquo;t win,&rdquo; said Carrack. &ldquo;The game&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; Forecastle could see the whites of his eyes; he looked almost terror-struck. This kind of playing around with luck must have been quite disturbing for a superstitious seafarer to watch, he supposed.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; the captain said, thinking it over. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already won. So why didn&rsquo;t it&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Someone up above may have yelled out a warning, a sliver of a second before the blast, but it was no matter. <em>HMS Double Eagle</em> all but blew apart.</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Duke Forecastle - Part 18]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Double Eagle</em> ran with the wind, the Anchorbar line in hot pursuit behind her. The frigate was faster than the fleet, but she had only minutes before the hex border would halt her progress. At that point, the ship would be pinned in and swarmed.</p><p>Captain Forecastle climbed up to the poop deck with Carrack in tow, to get a better view of their pursuers. The great brown form of the ship&rsquo;s namesake perched there, too, with one head watching the captain, and the other gazing alertly out to sea.</p><p>Forecastle had called the bird down from the topmast, but this was the first time he&rsquo;d seen it alight on a railing instead of a yard. Up close, he could see that it had wounds on its legs and body from the fight. It seemed untroubled by them, though.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, bear with me,&rdquo; he said to the helmsman, holding up his hands helplessly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the terms, so I don&rsquo;t know how to <em>say</em> the commands right. But this is what I want: either get them all spread out,&rdquo; he said, making vague gestures toward the enemy line, &ldquo;or get them in each other&rsquo;s way. I want it so they can&rsquo;t clearly see what we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said Carrack solemnly. He stood on tiptoes for a moment, taking sight of the Anchorbar vessels. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo; tight now, sir, though. I don&rsquo;t see as how we could loosen the line. We could break across it, maybe. But that&rsquo;d be tricky. They&rsquo;ve got the weather gage.&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle looked, too. Across a sea of moderate swell, the thirteen enemy ships were holding a regimented battle line. It was capped at either end by their heaviest battleships, both 4-deckers which completely outclassed <em>Eagle</em>. But it was the <em>number</em> of ships that worried him, not their size.</p><p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t, though. Right? Not with one ship? They&rsquo;d...&rdquo; he struggled to remember the book on battle tactics. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the navy term for crossfire? They&rsquo;d shoot us from both sides.&rdquo;</p><p>Carrack glanced at the bird. &ldquo;Double up, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>That was it. &ldquo;Double up on us. Yes. That&rsquo;s not what I want. I want to fight them one at a time, in single ship-to-ship beam fights, where the others don&rsquo;t have a clear view of us. And I don&rsquo;t want to grapple.&rdquo; He looked again. The line was somewhat slanted, with a leading and trailing edge to it. &ldquo;Can we flank them? Get around that nearer side of the line?&rdquo;</p><p>Carrack put both his hands on the painted rail, squinting through his still-puffy eyes at the horizon. He hunched his shoulders, seemingly uncomfortable to be standing so close to the eagle.</p><p>&ldquo;Hafta be the man-o&rsquo;-war we fight first,&rdquo; he said dubiously, after a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, do that,&rdquo; the captain ordered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what ship we&rsquo;re fighting. In fact, the bigger the better. It&rsquo;ll block their view more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye-aye.&rdquo; Carrack gave him the rare shipboard formality of a salute, then jumped away, taking the steps down to the quarterdeck in a single bound. &ldquo;Helm! Right full rudder!&rdquo;</p><p>The de facto first officer shouted a steady stream of other orders from the command deck, and the riggers began calling out to one another in seafarer-speak, but Forecastle did not listen. He remained at the poop deck railing, standing right next to the eagle.</p><p>Sails snapped in the breeze overhead. The ship began tilting to starboard. The shadows of the lines and shrouds shifted over the planks. They swung away from the edge of the hex.</p><p>He looked up at the bird. Two of its four yellow eyes stared back down at him, while its other head peered down into the sea, searching for fish. Or maybe it was tracking their quakken, below the water.</p><p>Almost unconsciously, he reached out and smoothed the feathers on its nearer neck. They stood right back up again.</p><p>He laughed. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;pretty bird.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re a homely beast,&rdquo; he said, smiling up at it, &ldquo;but you are probably the best fighting unit I&rsquo;ve ever commanded.&rdquo;</p><p>At that, the eagle opened its black-tipped ivory beak and lifted its head up. A beam of sun glistened on its pink tongue, but it made no sound. It then closed its beak with a tiny click, bent down, and pecked once at the railing by Forecastle&rsquo;s hand, making a significant gouge in the wood and paint. Forecastle didn&rsquo;t flinch. He reached up and stroked its neck again. The feathers were short and stiff, like the bristles of a groomsman&rsquo;s brush.</p><p>&ldquo;I also think you&rsquo;re a pretty smart creature, too. &lsquo;Pretty smart bird,&rsquo; maybe? Would you settle for that? Pretty smart bird.&rdquo; He kept petting it. The bird did not blink, but a white nictitating membrane slid over its pupilless eye.</p><p>He checked its stats:</p><p><strong>Unit: Double Eagle</strong></p><p><strong>Level: 2</strong></p><p><strong>Class: Heavy Flyer</strong></p><p><strong>Move: 0/26 (crewed to: </strong><strong><em>HMS Double Eagle</em></strong><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>Hits: 11/20</strong></p><p><strong>Combat: 8</strong></p><p><strong>Defense: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Special: Flyer</strong></p><p><strong>Special: Capture - capacity: 1, transport: 0</strong></p><p><strong>Special: Luckamancy Reserve - capacity: 3/30</strong></p><p>A mere 3 points of its Luckamancy remained, after saving Cat. And that was probably far too little for what he had in mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you <em>are</em> smart,&rdquo; he said, as he scratched it gently down its back. It shrugged contently. &ldquo;I need you to do something quite complicated now.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>Being one ship against a formation afforded <em>Double Eagle </em>an advantage in agility. She could turn as she wished, but if the long battle line wanted to change course in response, then orders would have to be given, and signal flags waved down the line.</p><p>In its pursuit, the enemy formation was like a fishing net, intended as much to cut off the quarry&rsquo;s route of escape as to align their own firepower. Its leading edge was knifing in on the northeast side, where Anchorbar had the greater benefit of the gage.</p><p>At first, the Anchormen allowed the frigate to slow and sail closer against the wind, giving up her speed and distance (the only tactical blessings she still had left). But as it became clear that the Seaworld ship might just be able to round the line and squeeze by, their tight formation finally broke. A barque and two fast brigantines hove to and lagged behind the fleet, holding back in case of a chase. Then the remainder of the Anchorbar line bent and swung around to the southwest, to cut off their retreat.</p><p>At the fore, the man-o&rsquo;-war did not try to race to cut them off. Instead, she trimmed her sails and lingered, as if welcoming the chance to lay down a raking broadside or two as <em>Double Eagle</em> passed within her range.</p><p>&ldquo;Three held back, and the line&rsquo;s down to ten,&rdquo; he said to Carrack, pointing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had to spread farther apart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that far enough, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo;</p><p>Visibility was all too clear in this hex. It had been limited in the bigger battle, so Forecastle didn&rsquo;t know if the enemy was yet aware of the double eagle. But he believed in holding his cards close. The bird was now perched on the lowest yard on the mizzen (which, for some perverse reason was not <em>called</em> the mizzenyard, the way the other masts had a foreyard and a mainyard there, but was called a &ldquo;cross-jack yard&rdquo;), hidden from the enemy&rsquo;s view by the (again, Titans, <em>why?</em>) cross-jack sail.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re presenting for a broadside,&rdquo; said Carrack, indicating the big battleship.</p><p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re expecting one from us, as we pass,&rdquo; nodded Forecastle. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not going to pass. Get ready to turn and sail right for &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p><p>Most of the rest of the enemy ships still had line-of-sight on the frigate, but the main fleet of ten was now nearly in full conjunction behind the man-o&rsquo;-war. The farther ones shrank to little dots. Most of them were too far away to spot the eagle in the air, he thought. But before he could risk letting it fly, he needed the cover of fire.</p><p>Fire came.</p><p>Sooner than he&rsquo;d expected, a bolt of Shockmancy lanced out from the man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s main beams, struck the fore topgallant sail, and cut the top of the foremast off completely. A chunk of timber, still with Her Majesty&rsquo;s pennant attached to it, tumbled overboard. And with it fell the bodies of two riggers, into the brine. Pieces of sailcloth and frayed rope fluttered on the breeze.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t see the damage too well from the command position, but he understood what had happened. His sense of this ship and its condition was sharper than it had been for <em>Unsinkable II</em>. Maybe that was something that came with being captain.</p><p>&ldquo;Not even a warning shot?&rdquo; he muttered to Carrack.</p><p>&ldquo;Think it was meant to be, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said the first officer. &ldquo;We should still be out of range for a minute or so. A hit from that distance was just cursed good luck!&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle raised his eyebrows.</p><p>He turned and glanced up at the eagle, which was perched above and behind him. Its points said:</p><p><strong>Special: Luckamancy Reserve - capacity: 4/30</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Cursed,&rdquo; said the captain, shaking his head, &ldquo;is exactly correct, Mister Carrack.&rdquo; The creature had gained a point in its Luckamancy Reserve, almost certainly at the cost of two crew and a piece of the mast. <em>Pretty smart bird?</em> Well. Indeed. &ldquo;Instead of running, I think we should&rsquo;ve been playing cards this whole time.&rdquo;</p><p>Carrack snorted. &ldquo;Like as not, Cap&rsquo;n. For all the chance we&rsquo;ve got left to us.&rdquo;</p><p>The first mate took a step away, as if intending to get a closer look at the damage, but Forecastle clapped him on the shoulder, turned him around, and looked him in the eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you happen to have a deck?&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Holiday Break, Part 2 (David is moving)]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned earlier, we're going to take a bit of a slowdown on updates for a while. Christmas involved travel for everyone on Team Erfworld, and Linda and I will be doing a retreat with some friends over the New Year's holiday. Meanwhile, David is moving halfway across the country, and his ability to draw the comic won't be restored to full capacity until about mid-January.<br /><br />So I'll be updating Duke Forecastle until it concludes, and there may be one or two Book 3 updates as well, but don't expect us to resume to the normal schedule until the second half of January.<br /><br />I hope everyone's having a wonderful holiday season, and best wishes to all of you for a great 2015!<br /><br />-Rob</p>]]></description>

  <title><![CDATA[Duke Forecastle - Part 17]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;A trick&rsquo;s a fine thing, and turnabout is fair play,&rdquo; said Captain Forecastle through the little window in the brig door. &ldquo;We tamed an eagle, but you tamed a quakken. That&rsquo;s what you meant on the quarterdeck.&rdquo;</p><p>He could see the Anchorman&rsquo;s white teeth, smiling through the darkness. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; like that, Seaworld.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you want me to croak you?&rdquo; asked the Captain. &ldquo;If we do, will it attack the ship?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the prisoner, still grinning, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just in a rush ta see the City of Heroes.&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle snorted. &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re qualified?&rdquo;</p><p>The smile disappeared in the dark. &ldquo;We croaked a fleet admiral and sunk th&rsquo;enemy flagship,&rdquo; said the man in the cell plainly. &ldquo;If that don&rsquo;t qualify, then th&rsquo; Titans&rsquo;d better tell us why.&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle didn&rsquo;t have a retort for that one. Instead, he reclaimed his line of questioning. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a seafarer unit, are you?&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Chains rattled. &ldquo;Nay. And neither are you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Forecastle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. And I&rsquo;d wager you wish you could send a message home, to let them know that lubbers can tame double eagles, as well as quakkens.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not take that wager,&rdquo; said the prisoner, flashing his smile again. &ldquo;Nor <em>any</em> wager, with a man what bets with a two-headed coin.&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle nodded and chuckled, acknowledging the wit. He was hoping he could build a rapport with the prisoner, to get the information he needed. And despite it all, he found he didn&rsquo;t actually hate this man. War was war. If they&rsquo;d been popped on the same side, the Anchorman warlord would have been his superior officer. Like as not, he would have preferred that to life under Chequer&rsquo;s command.</p><p>&ldquo;You did fight well, Warlord.&rdquo; He touched the nick on his scalp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll allow as much. That was some, uh...daunting shooting you did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye. And that was some fancy duckin&rsquo; ye did,&rdquo; said the warlord in the cell.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Forecastle, and unable to let the segue pass, &ldquo;so, speaking of ducks...&rdquo; The Anchorman laughed at that. &ldquo;Do you want to tell me how you tame them?&rdquo;<br /><br />The prisoner kept on laughing for a while, then trailed off and grew quiet. Forecastle gave him some time to answer, but heard nothing in reply.</p><p>He began thinking of another tack. There wasn&rsquo;t much time left, with the turn ending soon. He had his guesses about the quakken, but information was better than intuition. He wanted answers, from the only unit on board who knew. He just didn&rsquo;t know much about interrogation.</p><p>But then the Anchorman warlord spoke up again. &ldquo;Who <em>says</em> we tame them, Seaworld? Who says?&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle cocked an eyebrow. &ldquo;I found the porthole in the hold, prisoner. There&rsquo;s no point in being coy about it; I saw the beast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You saw the beast, did ye?&rdquo; said the prisoner. &ldquo;And what level was it? Was it an enemy unit a&rsquo; t&rsquo;all?&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle took in a sudden breath through his nose.</p><p>&ldquo;No. It wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, wincing. He hadn&rsquo;t even bothered to size it up as an opponent, or he&rsquo;d have known: that quakken out there was still feral. &ldquo;Then why is it leaving the ship alone?&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, the ship&rsquo;s bell rang out, in three groups of three clangs.</p><p>So soon... Seaworld&rsquo;s turn had reached its end. The Anchorbar fleet would soon be sailing in. Inside the cell, that white, perfect smile beamed out of the darkness at him.</p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t any more, Seaworld.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a thump from belowdecks.</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>Turn upon tedious turn at sea had left Forecastle&rsquo;s thinking scattered like sunlight on the water. As the days rolled on, he&rsquo;d felt his brain going soft from disuse, and felt himself powerless to stop it.</p><p>So what was it about a battle that gathered up all the light in his mind and made it a beam weapon, focused straight, narrow and hot?</p><p>There were choices, certainly. He could dash topside, to command this ship the way Admiral Chequer would have, go stand on the quarterdeck where a captain should be. Or he could run to the hold and try to strike at the quakken the moment it breached the inner hull. Maybe with the double eagle&rsquo;s luck, he could crit the monster enough times to croak it.</p><p>But in the clarity of the moment, these didn&rsquo;t even seem like sensible options to him.</p><p>Instead, he leaped down the companionway steps, and ran for the furnace.</p><p style="text-align: center;">---</p><p>With ferals, the general rule was: if it is bigger than you, it will hunt you. If not, it won&rsquo;t willingly engage. So why wasn&rsquo;t the quakken attacking? Or more precisely, why did it wait until the end of Seaworld&rsquo;s turn to attack the ship? Was there some level of tameness between &ldquo;tame&rdquo; and &ldquo;feral?&rdquo;</p><p>Thinking back, there was only one time in his life when Forecastle had seen a heavy feral unit with a tactical advantage decline to attack.</p><p>That unit had been receiving buckets of fish, delivered by the crew of a warship.</p><p>&ldquo;Gangway!&rdquo; he ordered, clambering up the steps and into the sunshine.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t the only one shouting. Every few seconds, the planks below his boots would thud or shudder with the slam of the quakken&rsquo;s beak below. Crewmen were scrambling through the ship in all directions, but to what possible purpose, he didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>A three-deck climb with a basket in the crook of each elbow was a clumsy maneuver, leading Forecastle to drop a number of loaves and fishes along the way. But he had enough left over to start flinging fistfuls of fresh food overboard as soon as he reached the main deck&rsquo;s starboard rail. Loaf, fish, loaf, fish, over the gunwales and into the sea below.</p><p>The bread floated on the water, but most of the fish did not. A shriek came down from the mizzen topsail yard. The double eagle, sounding almost offended, took to the air and dove into the water to retrieve the fish.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you dumb... Get out of there!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for you!&rdquo;</p><p>A few seconds later, the eagle came up to the surface. One of its heads was holding the biggest of the fishes he&rsquo;d thrown overboard. The other glared at him, and snapped up a small floater from the water near it. Then it spread its enormous wings and rose skyward.</p><p>Forecastle resumed hurling food. &ldquo;Come up,&rdquo; he muttered through his teeth. &ldquo;Come up!&rdquo;</p><p>Some of the crew stood by and stared at him. He glanced over at one bewildered sailor, and it suddenly struck him how potentially stupid it was to be betting his life and all of theirs on this gambit. He could clearly imagine himself standing before the Titans and explaining why, as his second ship of the day sank below the waves, he&rsquo;d stood there flinging fish. <em>&ldquo;What else was there to do?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d have to tell Them, lamely. &ldquo;I made my best guess.&rdquo;</em></p><p>&ldquo;Bring up all the food you can,&rdquo; he ordered the crewman. &ldquo;Hurry. Get some help with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, sir.&rdquo;<br /><br />Forecastle threw the last loaf over the side, watched it plop into the water, and listened. Plenty of sailors were still shouting, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure the ship was still under attack. The buffeting of the hull from underwater was not as jarring from up here. He could sense that <em>Double Eagle</em> had been damaged, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be getting worse. He dared to hope that the monster had at least paused in its fury.</p><p>He picked up the fish basket, and dumped the last few of them overboard. The double eagle squawked at him sternly as it circled overhead. It had eaten the small fish and was tearing up the bigger one as it flew along erratically.</p><p>Forecastle leaned on the railing, looking and listening for any sign of the yellow beast. Instead, he heard the tocsin of the ship&rsquo;s bell, in quick double-rings: enemy sighted.</p><p>&ldquo;Northeast, ahoy!&rdquo; cried the lookout.</p><p>The captain followed the directive and peered toward the horizon. The view from the main deck wasn&rsquo;t as good as from the command deck, but it didn&rsquo;t have to be. At least a dozen white sails accented with burgundy banners formed a battle line across the edge of the hex.</p><p>He leaned back over the rail again and looked at the loaves of bread bobbing in the sea. Were those bubbles in the green sea, or...</p><p>&ldquo;Orders, Captain?&rdquo;</p><p>He turned around to see Carrack standing there, his face swollen and bruised from the beating Forecastle had given him. He glanced around the deck. Collier was at the helm, Dromond on the command deck, looking anxious.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re speaking to me now?&rdquo; asked Forecastle. He&rsquo;d been so furious with this man half an hour before. Now that it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter whether the crew listened to him or not, here he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, sir. Apologies, Cap&rsquo;n. What are your orders?&rdquo;</p><p>Forecastle glanced to the northeast. The wall of ships seemed a little taller. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing we can do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I have no orders. When they get close enough, shoot at them, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned his back to the helmsman, and looked down into the green water. The soggy bread loaves bobbed there, useless and sad. Wasted in the sea, as was he.</p><p>&ldquo;Um. Maneuvers or something, Captain?&rdquo; said Carrack behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Forecastle. &ldquo;Leave me alone. I&rsquo;m fishing.&rdquo;</p><p>In his head, this plan had seemed so obvious. The quakken would eat the food, and then defend the frigate the way it had against <em>Unsinkable II</em>. But the quakken wasn&rsquo;t coming up. And anyway, what good would it do to have one ship and one monster against a fleet, if all the Anchormen ships had quakkens of their own?</p><p>Forecastle leaned on the rail, feeling spent. He was all out of ideas, out of move, and out of time. Let the quakken sink them, then. Or the Anchorbar fleet. Let it end. He certainly was not bound for the City of Heroes, but &ldquo;back in the box&rdquo; sounded quite wonderful to him at this moment.</p><p>Gradually, the sailors&rsquo; shouts trailed off and the deck mostly fell silent, leaving only the creaking of the ship&rsquo;s timbers. Only then was he certain that the quakken had stopped hitting the hull.</p><p>...That, and because he could see it moving in the water.</p><p>He stood up straight and gripped the rail. A yellow cloud in the green sea, nearly half the size of the ship, flashed out of <em>Double Eagle</em>&rsquo;s shadow and turned sharply. Then it turned twice again, away from the ship, and back toward her. A few shouts and curses came from the rigging above. Forecastle could only stare in silence.</p><p>The cloud became brighter. Just before it broke the water&rsquo;s surface, he saw the streak of orange, and then the great beak was grabbing the loaves from the surface of the sea with a violent head-bobbing motion.</p><p>From the rigging, he heard calls that he knew were preparations to fire the beams. &ldquo;Hold fire!&rdquo; he ordered, to no-one in particular.</p><p>The quakken gathered up all the floating loaves, then rose out of the water and towered over the deck. Its bulbous head tilted back, and it unleashed a rasping roar unlike anything Forecastle had ever heard.</p><p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;More bread...&rdquo; he said, his voice breaking a bit. &ldquo;Get more bread!&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><br />---</p><p>The quakken took around seventy loaves to become friendly, or attached, or whatever it was that bound it to this ship. Forecastle threw them to it at first, as hard as he could, as it swam and thrashed around violently. The waves it made rolled over the rails, and the frigate rocked in its wake.</p><p>But the beast quickly grew more docile, and began to show an interest in him. It settled into a patient, bobbing squat on the water&rsquo;s surface. The sailors brought him baskets of bread, and kept their distance from the starboard rail.</p><p>&ldquo;Fishing...&rdquo; Carrack muttered.</p><p>The last few loaves the quakken took, it picked daintily from his hands as he leaned over the side. It could just as easily have plucked Forecastle himself up and swallowed him whole. But it wanted bread. He offered it fish and dried meat. Only the loaves met its approval.</p><p>As they began to run low on bread, he worried about having enough to satisfy it. But it reached the apparent limit of its appetite while a few bits of bread remained in the baskets. It rasped out another terrible cry, and dove below the boat again.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t tamed it. He couldn&rsquo;t see its stats. But it <em>liked </em>him, just as the eagle had. He had confidence that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt the ship now, as long as he was on board.</p><p>Which was all well and good, but the Anchorbar navy was certainly about to.</p><p>They were closing fast, and each ship had its own friendly quakken. In fact, he could spot them now. Like the wake snakes, they were much easier to see near another vessel than your own. Perhaps that was why they&rsquo;d held their ambush in a storm hex.</p><p>He counted thirteen ships in a line, and each had a yellow cloud swimming beneath it. Thirteen ships and thirteen quakkens.</p><p>And also...</p><p>Also thirteen non-seafarers, to whom those quakkens were uniquely loyal. <em>Why&rsquo;n&rsquo;cha croak me, Seaworld?</em></p><p>&ldquo;I have an order, Carrack,&rdquo; the Captain told his helmsman.</p><p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Evade. Buy us as much time as you can,&rdquo; he said, looking the man in his swollen eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done fishing now. Time to hunt.&rdquo;</p><p>He cupped his hand to his mouth and called to the sky. &ldquo;Eaaagullll!&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /></p><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://static.erfworld.com/images/Forecastle_illustration.png" alt=""></div>]]></description>
