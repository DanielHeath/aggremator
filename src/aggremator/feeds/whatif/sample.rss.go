  &lt;a href=&quot;//what-if.xkcd.com/132/&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hotter than Average&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;question&quot;&gt;I saw a sign at a hot springs tub saying &amp;quot;Caution: Water is hotter than average&amp;quot; with water at about 39°C. Although they were presumably trying to say &amp;quot;hotter than the average swimming pool,&amp;quot; this got me wondering: What is the average temperature of all water on the Earth’s surface, and how does that temperature compare to 39°C?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;—Graham Ward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be selling the sign-maker short. Whether they explicitly intended it or not, the wording on their sign hints at something kind of profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Also my boss said I&amp;#39;d be fired if I keep making rambling signs like this. Then he ... (see next sign for rest of story)&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/132/profound.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sign is true in the literal sense, in that 39°C is hotter than most water you&amp;#39;ll find on Earth. But it&amp;#39;s also true in a deeper sense, one that ties together the concept of heat, springs, and averages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the temperature of groundwater in an area &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ngwa.org/Fundamentals/studying/Pages/Groundwater-temperature%27s-measurement-and-significance.aspx&quot;&gt;is equal&lt;/a&gt; to the year-round average air temperature of the surface. Water is a terrific absorber of energy, requiring huge amounts of it to change temperature.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Which is why pots of it take so long to boil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Underground reservoirs of water tend to warm up and cool down too sluggishly to respond to the comparatively brief winter-summer temperature swings.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;It also takes a while for heat to work its way downward, so sometimes deep parts of water bodies will reach their maximum temperature when it&amp;#39;s winter on the surface. Rock works the same way; if you drill a hole deep into the bedrock, you can see &lt;a href=&quot;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/30810/0000468.pdf?sequence=1&quot;&gt;historical temperatures&lt;/a&gt; stacked vertically, as waves of heat and cold moving downward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This property makes springs a useful &amp;quot;thermometer&amp;quot; for an area. Instead of spending a year measuring the temperature each day and night, and then calculating the average, you can just stick a thermometer in a spring any time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;HYDROLOGY CANNOT HELP YOU&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/132/rest.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/athens/learn2model/part-two/onsite/ex/jne_henrys_map.html&quot;&gt;map of groundwater temperatures&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll see it closely resembles a map of year-round &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/images/olstore/SelClimMapsPubOnlineReduced_3.pdf&quot;&gt;average air temperatures&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, see page 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this rule only holds true in places where the main energy source heating the groundwater is the same one heating the air—sunlight. While this is true in most areas, in a few geologically-active spots, water is warmed far above this baseline by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~manga/paper75.pdf&quot;&gt;flow of energy&lt;/a&gt; from deep within the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sign at the hot springs told you that the water there was &amp;quot;hotter than average,&amp;quot; it wasn&amp;#39;t just saying, &amp;quot;This water is hot.&amp;quot; In a sense, it was saying, &amp;quot;This water, unlike all the springwater most of us ever encounter, isn&amp;#39;t tied to the average summer/winter day/night air temperature for the area. This water is &lt;em&gt;hotter&lt;/em&gt; than average.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;WE HOLD YOUR LIFE IN OUR HANDS.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/132/domain.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So give the signmakers some credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;//what-if.xkcd.com/131/&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Microwaves&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;question&quot;&gt;I have had a particular problem for as long as I can remember. Any time I attempt to heat left over Chinese food in a microwave, it fails to heat completely through somewhere. Usually the center but not always and usually rice, but often it will be a small section of meat. It&amp;#39;s baffling and has made me automatically adjust heating times to over 2 minutes. In most cases this tends to heat the bowl or plate more than the food. So I suppose the question is what is the optimal time to heat left over Chinese food in the microwave, how about an 800 watt microwave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;—James&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great question. Since the answer isn&amp;#39;t too hard to find by Googling, normally I would skip it, but the answer is also something that I never really learned while growing up, so I&amp;#39;d like to try to answer it, for the sake of anyone else out there like me who spent years confused by microwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, the disclaimer: I am not an expert on food preparation or food safety. Actual experts on food safety can be found at US Department of Agriculture, which publishes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/appliances-and-thermometers/microwave-ovens-and-food-safety&quot;&gt;a good FAQ page on microwave oven safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on to James&amp;#39;s question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of different effects that cause microwaves to heat food unevenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;I don&amp;#39;t think this book came with the microwave. I don&amp;#39;t know where I got this.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/131/microwave.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is that microwaves have hot and cold spots. You can see this by filling a microwave with damp thermal paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://physicamechanica.wordpress.com/2013/12/04/speed-of-light-in-a-microwave/&quot;&gt;marshmallows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ3X3ppLKrM&quot;&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, or—possibly best of all—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2011/microwave-oven-diagnostics-with-indian-snack-food/&quot;&gt;appalams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason microwaves don&amp;#39;t cook evenly comes straight from physics. When you continuously feed waves into a space—which is what microwaves do—you&amp;#39;ll often have some &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; spots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Miss Mary Mack Mack Mack all dressed in black black black&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/131/standing.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two dimensions, you get a similar but more complicated pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dead spots are the reason microwaves are designed with rotating platters—the idea is that each part of the food will pass through at least one hot spot. Microwave designers use a lot of tricks to try to vary the pattern to minimize dead spots, but no one does it perfectly; all microwaves will heat at least a little bit unevenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major reason for cold spots in microwaved food is something touched on in &lt;a href=&quot;http://what-if.xkcd.com/130/&quot;&gt;last week&amp;#39;s article&lt;/a&gt;: Microwaves aren&amp;#39;t absorbed very well by ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a problem, right? It just means that if your food is partly or entirely frozen, you just need to microwave it longer. But when you do that, something interesting happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When ice melts, it turns to water,&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://transportation.ky.gov/district-7/pages/citation-boulevard.aspx&quot;&gt;citation needed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; absorb microwaves very well. When the first pockets of ice turn to water, they start absorbing more microwaves and heating very quickly, even though the ice around them hasn&amp;#39;t even melted. Those melted parts can easily heat enough to start &lt;em&gt;cooking&lt;/em&gt; the food while other parts are still frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if you defrost frozen meat in your microwave, it could be hot to the touch over most of its surface, but still have a solid chunk of ice in it somewhere. If it does, when you plop it on the stove,&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Or in a &lt;em&gt;pan&lt;/em&gt; on the stove, or whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the thawed parts might finish cooking before the frozen parts have even started to warm up, giving you a large chunk of raw meat in the middle of your steak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts to explain some of the weird instructions commonly seen on microwavable food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When instructions say &lt;strong&gt;let stand for 1-2 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;#39;s not just to protect your mouth from hot food—it&amp;#39;s giving the hot and cold spots time to equalize, so the whole thing will be sufficiently heated throughout. And if some part of the food doesn&amp;#39;t conduct heat well (e.g. rice) or contains a lot of chunks of ice (e.g. frozen fruit or meat) they also might tell you to &lt;strong&gt;stir midway through cooking&lt;/strong&gt;. This helps to transfer the heat more evenly into the food, move food away from cold spots, and also break up chunks of ice and mix them with warmer pockets of water to help melt them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helps us explain why James is so perplexed. He&amp;#39;s adjusting the obvious variable—total cooking time—and no matter what value he chooses, he&amp;#39;s getting bad results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Fig. 3: Why Everything Sucks&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/131/variables.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to mess with other variables. First, he can redistribute the heat by pausing halfway through microwaving to stir the food. Second, for things that are harder to stir, he can give the heat time to equalize on its own. If he microwaves his food for a short period, waits a moment, then zaps it again, the heat will have time to spread from the hot spots to the cold spots in between zaps, resulting in more evenly-heated food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to one last surprising&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;This was surprising to me, anyway; I used microwaves for almost 20 years before I realized it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aspect of microwaves: Power level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;But, like, more ANGRILY.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/131/same.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that &amp;quot;turning the microwave off every so often to let the food cool&amp;quot; is exactly what the &amp;quot;power level&amp;quot; setting does! Choosing a lower power level doesn&amp;#39;t actually change the strength of the microwaves; it just means that the microwave generator won&amp;#39;t be running the whole time. When you cook something on 50% power, you may notice the microwave&amp;#39;s sound changing every so often; that&amp;#39;s the dynamo turning on and off.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;The length of these on/off periods (duty cycle) is surprisingly long, partly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microwaveresearch.com/microwave-selection.php&quot;&gt;because&lt;/a&gt; switching off and on is hard on the magnetron. This is also the reason why, if you normally cook something for 2 minutes on 50% power, cooking it for 1:30 won&amp;#39;t necessarily deliver 75% as much heat like you&amp;#39;d expect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While it&amp;#39;s on, the microwave is running at full power. In effect, the microwave is just automating the tedious task of zapping something a bunch of times on &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; for 10 seconds each and letting it sit for a while in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my advice to James is simple: Use a lower power level, stir your food partway through microwaving, and let it sit for a few minutes before you eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And FYI, if you cut a grape in almost in half and microwave it, you&amp;#39;ll create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=microwave+grape&quot;&gt;bursts of plasma&lt;/a&gt;. (You also might damage your microwave, so do it at your own risk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;BZZZZZT&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/131/grape.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has nothing to do with your question. I just wanted you to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;//what-if.xkcd.com/130/&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Snow Removal&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;question&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ve long thought about putting a flamethrower on the front of a car to melt snow and ice before you drive across it. Now I&amp;#39;ve realized that a flamethrower is impractical, but what about a high-powered microwave emitter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;—Matt Van Opens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, your flamethrower idea is actually the &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; practical of the two. The flamethrower also has the advantage that, unlike the microwave, it won&amp;#39;t interfere with wifi (unless you aim it directly at the router).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;This is the 802.11a/b/g flamethrower; be careful using on n targets.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/130/flamethrower.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this article from Boston, which is currently buried under &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/please-stop-snowing&quot;&gt;a truly ridiculous amount of snow&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;ve had more snow &lt;a href=&quot;http://weather.ou.edu/~splillo/misc.html&quot;&gt;in the past 30 days&lt;/a&gt; than Anchorage, Alaska usually gets in an entire winter.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, Anchorage is on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NWSBoston/status/567172928593485824&quot;&gt;wondering&lt;/a&gt; where their snow went and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NWSAnchorage/status/567566488517619712&quot;&gt;threatening revenge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/567350490912931840&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; a neat visualization of the atmospheric pattern during these polar vortexes. Vortices. Whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Our transit system &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/02/14/transportation/U7vNqP861gKQFRly2jmjdL/story.html&quot;&gt;has broken down&lt;/a&gt; and our roofs&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Tolkien prefers &lt;em&gt;rooves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whdh.com/story/28133433/dozens-of-roof-collapses-reported-across-new-england&quot;&gt;collapsing&lt;/a&gt;. The mayor gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/02/15/boston-mayor-seems-pretty-tired-all-this-dang-snow/OYtAnLLNQ2iMBMRaxTJYzJ/story.html?s_campaign=bcom%3Asocialflow%3Atwitter&quot;&gt;a press conference&lt;/a&gt; in which he announced, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what to say to anybody anymore. Hopefully it will stop eventually.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So snow removal is on all our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But snow is hard to melt. (And we&amp;#39;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NotifyBoston/status/564524089017401347&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;I love that tweet because it sort of sounds like it comes from an alternate fairy-tale universe where cities farm snow and snow-melters form the base of the economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Your microwave idea certainly &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like it should be more practical than a flamethrower. Microwaves seem clean and efficient; after all, we don&amp;#39;t use flamethrowers in our kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;MORE LIKE GUY FIERY [FWOOOOOOSH]&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/130/kitchen.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a big problem: Microwaves heat water very well, but they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/-324719c1f8/&quot;&gt;don&amp;#39;t really work on ice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are other ways to get energy into the ice. In addition to your flamethrower suggestion, you could, for example, use infrared heat lamps or lasers.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Pick a frequency where snow has a low albedo; otherwise, the FBI may hunt you down for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/why-its-terrible-idea-point-lasers-airplanes-n28841&quot;&gt;lasering aircraft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But whatever you use, you&amp;#39;ll run into another problem: It takes an &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; lot of energy to melt snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melting a gram of snow takes about 335 joules of energy. To put that another way, a 60-watt lightbulb is capable of melting about a pound of snow an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A foot of snow contains roughly the same amount of water as an inch of rain, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints/346/&quot;&gt;give or take&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;#39;s assume you&amp;#39;ve had a decent snowstorm of about a foot&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;For the record, by this standard, Boston has had a &amp;quot;decent snowstorm&amp;quot; every few days for the past month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—meaning an inch worth of water—and that you want to melt a 9-foot-wide swath while driving along at 55 mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, this happens to be one of those happy physics situations where we can just multiply together every number we&amp;#39;re looking at, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=55+mph+*+1+inch+*+9+feet+*+water+density+*+335+J%2Fgram&quot;&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt; turns out to be the measurement we want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[55\text{ mph}\times1\text{ inch}\times9\text{ feet}\times\text{water density}\times335\tfrac{\text{J}}{\text{gram}}=574\text{ megawatts}\]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s not the answer we&amp;#39;d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;. The nuclear reactor on an aircraft carrier, for example, produces less than 200 megawatts. To melt snow in front of your car, you&amp;#39;d need &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Your blinker is on.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/130/legal.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about your your original flamethrower idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline may have a phenomenally &lt;a href=&quot;http://what-if.xkcd.com/128/&quot;&gt;high energy density&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s not high enough. No matter how big the tank on your flamethrower was, you&amp;#39;d run out of fuel constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas mileage in the US is often measured in &amp;quot;miles per gallon&amp;quot; of gasoline. With your flamethrower guzzling fuel, your mileage would be about 17 &lt;em&gt;feet&lt;/em&gt; per gallon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be better off dropping the flamethrower entirely. Instead, take a cue from the rail agencies, who use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/01/23/mbtas_mattapan_line_relies_on_snowzilla_in_worst_weather/&quot;&gt;jet-engine-powered snowblowers&lt;/a&gt; to clear train tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it&amp;#39;s easier to just move the snow out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;So then the deer crests a hill, and on the other side are a bunch of deer all facing us, each one with another kid on its back. The cheetahs look startled, but then after a moment facing the deer, they decide to attack ...&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/130/cheetahs.png&quot;&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;//what-if.xkcd.com/129/&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Black Hole Moon&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;question&quot;&gt;What would happen if the Moon were replaced with an equivalently-massed black hole? If it&amp;#39;s possible, what would a lunar (&amp;quot;holar&amp;quot;?) eclipse look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;—Matt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not much&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Doctors warn that even sunglasses that block UVB will only protect you from the part of the Sun covered by them.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/129/eclipse.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A black hole the mass of the Moon would have an event horizon about the size of a sand grain. Specifically, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-001/htmldocs/images/chart.pdf&quot;&gt;one of my favorite charts&lt;/a&gt;, a black hole moon would be a grain of fine to medium-fine sand, and could pass through a sieve of size ASTM No. 70 or larger. I mean, I guess a black hole with the mass of the Moon would pass right through &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sieve, destroying it in the process, but that&amp;#39;s neither here nor there.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;The expression &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s neither here nor there&amp;quot; can be kind of confusing and ambiguous, but I guess that&amp;#39;s neither here nor there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Moon&amp;#39;s mass and position wouldn&amp;#39;t change, the tides on Earth wouldn&amp;#39;t change, either. When you&amp;#39;re floating outside a spherical mass, its pull on you is the same regardless of whether the mass is concentrated at the center of the sphere or spread out throughout it. If the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the Earth&amp;#39;s orbit wouldn&amp;#39;t change, although life on Earth &lt;a href=&quot;http://what-if.xkcd.com/49/&quot;&gt;might&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Moon gathered into a point, there&amp;#39;d be no moonlight, which would affect the life cycles of all kinds of nocturnal animals. But compared to a lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/1338/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; things we&amp;#39;ve done, that would be fairly minor. The Earth&amp;#39;s orbit is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v361/n6413/abs/361615a0.html&quot;&gt;stabilized by the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, but the lunar-mass black hole would probably serve the same role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg&quot;&gt;black hole Moon&lt;/a&gt; would be pretty low-profile. If it were much smaller, it would evaporate through &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation&quot;&gt;Hawking radiation&lt;/a&gt;, but a black hole the size of the Moon actually absorbs more energy from the cosmic background radiation than it emits through the Hawking mechanism. Our black hole would really be black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Not actual size, but actually not that far off.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/129/phases.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, if it didn&amp;#39;t eat anything. If the black hole devoured any objects, it would let off a tremendous blast of radiation. Black holes burn brightly as they devour things; the whirlpool of matter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gothosenterprises.com/black_holes/outside_black_holes.html&quot;&gt;heats up as it falls inward&lt;/a&gt;, causing it to glow brightly.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;A black hole can&amp;#39;t devour matter too fast, though, because at some point it would be producing so much radiation that it would blast its own &amp;quot;food&amp;quot; away. This is called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_luminosity&quot;&gt;Eddington limit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;If our black hole were devouring matter at the Eddington limit, it would be hot enough to sterilize the Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there&amp;#39;s not a lot out there for it to eat, so it wouldn&amp;#39;t glow very brightly for now. It would spend most of its time drastically altering the orbits of nearby dust particles—one sand grain pushing other sand grains around.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Even if it sucked in matter at the rate the Earth—with its much larger &amp;quot;collecting area&amp;quot;—sucks in interplanetary dust, it wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily be a problem for us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there would be one interesting effect: In addition to getting darker, Earth would get colder, because moonlight &lt;em&gt;warms&lt;/em&gt; the Earth. It&amp;#39;s a very tiny contributor to our global energy balance; the Moon is five or six orders of magnitude dimmer than the Sun. But it&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measurements show that global temperature varies with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000GL011651/abstract&quot;&gt;28-day cycle&lt;/a&gt;; all else being equal, the Earth is hottest during the full moon. It&amp;#39;s a tiny difference—small fractions of a degree—but it&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it turns out most of this effect is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; due to moonlight. The largest contributor is the fact that the Earth is slightly closer to the Sun during a full Moon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;SUN 90,000 KILOMILES&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/129/barycenter.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating the amount of energy radiated back to Earth by the Moon is deceptively tricky. The Moon reflects sunlight, but with some surprising twists. When the Moon is half-illuminated, you might think it would be half as bright as when full—but it&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.earthlink.net/~kitathome/LunarLight/moonlight_gallery/technique/moonbright.htm&quot;&gt;much less bright than that&lt;/a&gt;. And once you account for that, there are even &lt;em&gt;trickier&lt;/em&gt; effects to deal with, because science is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Like the fact that the waxing Moon is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2402251?sid=21105340972791&amp;amp;uid=2&amp;amp;uid=4&amp;amp;uid=3739808&amp;amp;uid=3739256&quot;&gt;20% brighter&lt;/a&gt; than the waning Moon, or that the Moon is a mild &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_surge&quot;&gt;retroreflector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Then, on top of all the weird visible-light effects, the Moon &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; heats up under the Sun, then radiates that heat as infrared light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a great discussion of the Moon&amp;#39;s effect on the Earth&amp;#39;s energy budget in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/67/12/10.1119/1.19109?ver=pdfcov&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Knox. The upshot is that the Moon&amp;#39;s infrared heat radiation turns out to affect Earth&amp;#39;s temperature about 10 times more than the visible moonlight, but still about 10 times less than the effect from gravity moving Earth closer and farther from the Sun. Knox even quantifies the effect this has on Earth&amp;#39;s radiation balance—the presence of infrared moonlight warms the planet by 1.2 milli-degrees Fahrenheit (m°F).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;I mean m°R difference.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/129/unit.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without moonlight, the planet &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; cool down slightly. But given the accelerating rate at which &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;re adding&lt;/a&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere—which changes the Earth&amp;#39;s energy balance—we&amp;#39;d make up the difference in a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all in all, the conversion of the Moon to a black hole might not even be that big of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, it happened on certain days between 1969 and 1972, in which case &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/events/centennials/nixon/images/exhibit/rn100-6-1-2.pdf&quot;&gt;Nixon&lt;/a&gt; would&amp;#39;ve needed yet another one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/1484/&quot;&gt;those speeches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Let&amp;#39;s try to put a man on the beach in Florida. This man, specifically.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/129/nixon.png&quot;&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;//what-if.xkcd.com/128/&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Zippo Phone&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;question&quot;&gt;What in my pocket actually contains more energy, my Zippo or my smartphone? What would be the best way of getting the energy from one to the other? And since I am already feeling like Bilbo in this one, is there anything else in my pocket that would have unexpected amounts of stored energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;—Ian Cummings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zippo lighter easily beats the phone, even though its fuel tank is barely half the size of a large phone&amp;#39;s battery, because hydrocarbons are fantastic at storing energy. Gasoline, butane, alcohol, and fat contain a lot of chemical energy, which is why our bodies run on them.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;I mean, the latter two, at least. You can&amp;#39;t eat gasoline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8203;&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;As far as I know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8203;&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Although technically swallowing gasoline &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthcare.utah.edu/the-scope/shows.php?shows=0_g9tzppx4&quot;&gt;may not kill you&lt;/a&gt;, according to Utah Poison Control specialist Brad Dahl. However, he cautions that you will find yourself &amp;quot;burping gasoline,&amp;quot; which is &amp;quot;not real tasty.&amp;quot; (Actual quote.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8203;&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Also, if you don&amp;#39;t rinse your throat afterward, it will give you chemical burns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much energy do they contain? Well, let&amp;#39;s put it this way: A fully-charged car battery holds barely as much energy as a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Solve for x.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/128/sandwich.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A container of butane the size of a phone battery could, in principle, power the phone about 13 times longer than the battery itself could.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;In the case of my phone, that could give me as much as three hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The obvious question, then, is &amp;quot;why doesn&amp;#39;t my phone run on propane?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;We should make another kid, because based on the questions it&amp;#39;s asking, I&amp;#39;m not confident this one is going to last.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/128/why.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious answer is &amp;quot;because your phone would catch fire,&amp;quot; but that&amp;#39;s not quite it. See, lithium-ion batteries are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; extremely flammable, and a huge amount of effort has gone into making &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lithium+ion+battery+explosion&quot;&gt;Michael Bay scenarios&lt;/a&gt; less common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is more complicated. People have wanted to build various kinds of &amp;quot;fuel cell&amp;quot; batteries for almost as long as we&amp;#39;ve had portable electronics. The allure of hydrocarbon energy storage continues to this day—if you do a Google search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=fuel+cell+phone+charger&quot;&gt;fuel cell phone charger&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll find news stories about new products announced every year. Many of them are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelkanellos/2013/01/31/why-are-portable-fuel-cells-such-a-flop/&quot;&gt;no longer available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want to power your phone with butane, the current hot project—as far as I can tell from a cursory search—seems to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/265641170/kraftwerk-highly-innovative-portable-power-plant&quot;&gt;kraftwerk portable USB generator&lt;/a&gt;, which has made over a million dollars on Kickstarter with several weeks left in its campaign. Of course, a portable battery of the same size could do a lot of the same things, but there are certainly some use cases where the butane charger offers advantages. If you place a premium on reducing weight, or have to go a long time without contact with the power grid, it could be a good option. Let&amp;#39;s put it this way: If the phrase &amp;quot;power your phone on butane&amp;quot;, makes you think, &amp;quot;hey, that would solve a problem I have!&amp;quot; then go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Now you have two problems, and both the original problem and the new problem are on fire.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/128/knock.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us the answer to Ian&amp;#39;s second question. The Zippo lighter has more energy, but getting it into the phone is a little difficult and requires the overhead of a fuel cell or generator. Getting the phone to start a fire, on the other hand, is quite reasonable, although it may require &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMy2_qNO2Y0&quot;&gt;doing bad things to the battery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian&amp;#39;s third question was &amp;quot;what else in my pocket might contain more energy?&amp;quot; Like Gollum, I have no idea what&amp;#39;s in your pocket,&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Or whether you&amp;#39;re happy to see me, for that matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but I can guess that it might contain one thing with more energy than a battery: Your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An adult man&amp;#39;s hand weighs about a pound.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;I wanted to put &amp;quot;citation needed&amp;quot; after that, but to my mild dismay I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exrx.net/Kinesiology/Segments.html&quot;&gt;actually do have a citation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The hand isn&amp;#39;t the fattiest part of the body, but if burned completely, it would probably give off about 500 watt-hours of energy, give or take. That&amp;#39;s 50 times the energy content of the phone battery, and almost 10 times that of the Zippo. It&amp;#39;s also about as much as a car battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for that matter, about as much as a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Look, I have a bunch of recipe cards and a jumper cable instruction card, and I only have one card folder. Anyway, can we hurry this up? I&amp;#39;m hungry.&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/a/128/jump.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
